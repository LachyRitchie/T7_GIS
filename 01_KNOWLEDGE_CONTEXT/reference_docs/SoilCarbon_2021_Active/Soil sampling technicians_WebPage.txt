The
Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) (Sequestering Carbon in Soils in Grazing Systems) Methodology Determination 2014
requires that soil sampling be conducted by either a qualified technician or a laboratory that meets the requirements specified in Section 4.7.
The
Soil Sampling and Analysis Method and Guidelines
states that a soil technician collecting, preparing and submitting soil samples to a laboratory must have either:
qualifications from a nationally accredited course, or
formal recognition of trade or prior learning in a number of competencies from a nationally accredited institution.
Project owners are responsible for ensuring the person/s they engage to collect, prepare and submit soil samples, meet the requirements in the
Soil Sampling and Analysis Method and Guidelines
.
Project owners must also be confident that their auditor will verify the qualifications of the person/s they engage to collect, prepare and submit soil samples for their project.
A qualification that covers environmental monitoring and includes the nationally accredited unit of competency MSS025007A 'Perform sampling and testing of soils', or similar, may meet these requirements.
