**Post-Thin Period**

\[[Event Window](137_Event%20Window.htm) : [Thin](140_Thin.htm) panel :
*Post-Thin Period* section\]

Specify the relative allocations of new growth to the tree components
not affected by a a thin in the period immediately after a thin.

**Details**

Tree growth can be modelled for modified behaviour for a period after a
thin, due to the response of the trees to the thin.

FullCAM models the post-growth differences using relative allocation
multipliers. Each multiplier multiplies the relative allocation that
would otherwise occur, for the whole length of the post-thin period. No
extra growth occurs, just the allocation of any growth to the various
components can be changed.

The modified behaviour during a post-thin period will be superceded by
the parameters in any sucsequent thinning event.
