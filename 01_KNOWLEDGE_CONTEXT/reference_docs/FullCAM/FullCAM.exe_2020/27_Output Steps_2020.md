**Output Steps**

\[[Timing](199_Timing.htm) page : *Output Steps* panel\]

Choose which simulation steps produce outputs, that you can view on the
[Output Window](168_Output%20Window.htm).

**Output Steps**

An output step is a simulation step in which the state of the simulation
is recorded.

The simulation state is recorded at the END of the output step, after
the movements of material for that step have occurred.

FullCAM always records the simulation step at the beginning and the end
of the simulation - the step immediately before the simulation starts is
always an output step, and the last step of the simulation is always an
output step.
