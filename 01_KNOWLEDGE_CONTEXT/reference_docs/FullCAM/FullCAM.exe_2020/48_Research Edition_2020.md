Research Edition

Standard and Research Editions

Each version of FullCAM comes in two editions, the standard edition and
the research edition.

The research edition of FullCAM is intended only for professional
researchers in carbon accounting and plant modelling. The research
edition is available upon reasonable request.

**Differences in Function**

Functionally, the research edition differs from the standard edition in
that:

- It includes the
  [3PG](http://www.fullcam.au/FullCAMServer2020/Help/115_3PG.htm) tree
  growth model. (Both editions contain the 3PG-lite model for computing
  the [Forest Productivity Index
  (FPI)](188_Forest%20Productivity%20Index.htm).)
- It can calculate the Forest Productivity Index from scratch (see
  [Configure Tree Production](108_Configure%20Tree%20Production.htm))
- It can do [Nitrogen
  Simulation](http://www.fullcam.au/FullCAMServer2020/Help/55_Nitrogen%20Simulation.htm)
  (other than just in the mulch, as part of
  [GENDEC](http://www.fullcam.au/FullCAMServer2020/Help/109_GENDEC.htm)).
- It includes version 26.5 of [RothC](114_RothC.htm).
