**Event Window**

\[[Events](136_Events.htm) page : *New* or *Edit* button\]\
\[[Standard Events of a
Species](142_Standard%20Events%20of%20a%20Species.htm) window : *New* or
*Edit* button\]

This window is for viewing and editing an individual event. See

[Event Timing](143_Event%20Timing.htm)

For help on the event-specific panel at the bottom of the window, see:

**Name**

Every event needs a (non-blank) name, and the name must be unique within
the event list (either the events for the plot, or the events for a
species). Press the *Auto Name* button and FullCAM will insert a unique
name based on the properties of the event.

**Type**

Select the type of event:

- If you are modelling a forest, the forest events are available.
- If you are modelling an agricultural system, the agricultural events
  are available.
- If you are modelling a mixed plot, both forest and agricultural events
  are available.

Only events that are possible with the current configuration and current
species inputs can be created or edited (if they are not possible then
they are also not shown in the *Events* page in the input window). Note
that:

**Notes**

Enter anything you like in this field. It will have no effect on
simulation but it may be useful for sorting events in the [Standard
Events of a Species](142_Standard%20Events%20of%20a%20Species.htm)
window.

**Add Days**

A offset may be applied to an event by entering a value in the *Days*
field and clicking *Add Days* button. This can be either positive or
negative and will move the event that number of days forward or back in
the event queue.
