**Data Builder**

\[*Data Builder* page of the input window of a plot document\]

Use the Data Builder to download data from the [Departmental
Server](219_Departmental%20Server.htm) into your plot document.

For help downloading data, see [Downloading Spatial
Data](207_Downloading%20Spatial%20Data.htm).

**Introduction**

The Data Builder allows you to easily build plots by downloading the
input data for your plot from the [Departmental
Server](219_Departmental%20Server.htm).

For further details and for assistance in building plots for complex
systems, such as managed forest and agricultural mixes (agroforestry),
please [Contact Us](190_Contact%20Us.htm).

Although the Data Builder has been designed for ease of use, it has
advanced functionality that allows experienced users to build complex
systems. Take care when downloading complex data or modifying downloaded
data, as modelling errors can result.

**Internet Connection to the FullCAM Server**

Using the Data Builder requires that your computer be connected to the
Internet. The Data Builder will automatically connect to the
[Departmental Server](219_Departmental%20Server.htm) as required.

**Plot Configuration**

Your choice of plot type and location will affect the species and regime
data offered for downloading. For example, [Regimes](235_Regimes.htm)
including a transition from pasture to plantation are not available for
a forest system because a pasture is modelled by an agricultural system.
