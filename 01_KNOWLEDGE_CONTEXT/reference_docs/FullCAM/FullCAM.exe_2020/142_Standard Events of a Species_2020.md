**Standard Events**

\[[Trees](215_Trees.htm) page or [Crops](216_Crops.htm) page : *Standard
Information for the Species* panel : *Events* button\]

Manage the standard events, for the current species ([Select a
Species](56_Select%20a%20Species.htm)).

The standard events are simply events which are made available for a
species for convenience. The standard events downloaded through Data
Builder are only available for convenience and may not be relevant or
applicable for the particular species of interest. The standard events
should not be confused with the event queue (on the
[Events](136_Events.htm) page). The event queue is the queue of events
that will be simulated during a plot simulation.

**Uses**

1.  If you often use a particular event on the *Events* page, you might
    want to store the event as a standard event. Then, when you want
    another such event on the *Events* page, you can load the input
    values from the standard event rather than retyping them. Also,
    storing the events that are typical for a given species is helpful
    when you give the species to others.
