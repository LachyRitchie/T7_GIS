\[[Trees](215_Trees.htm) page or [Crops](216_Crops.htm) page : *Select a

**Details**

A species is *in use* in the simulation either because it is the initial

The plot is only ready for simulation if every species that is used in
the simulation is ready. Species that are not ready to simulate are
shown in red.
