**Tree Growth Allocations**

\[[Growth Properties](42_Growth%20Properties.htm) window (for trees) :
Any of the *Allocations* buttons\]

This [Time Series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) is one of the
tree allocation time series windows, where you specify the relative
allocations of yield or NPP (see [Yield and
NPP](131_Yield%20and%20Net%20Primary%20Production.htm)) to the six tree
components: stems, branches, bark, leaves, coarse roots, or fine roots.

**Introduction**

The allocations determine the growth of a component, relative to the
other components. A high allocation means more growth of the component
compared to the other components, a low allocation means the component
grows slower than the other components. Hence, allocations are purely
relative: it is not the size of the numbers by themselves that matters,
only the ratios between the allocations to the various tree components.

Typically the stem (or bole) growth is the frame of reference, and the
mass increases of the other components relative to the stems are
recorded. If the relative stem growth is set to 1.0, then where the leaf
mass increment is a half of the stem mass increment it would be set to
0.5.

Data on allocations to various tree components can be found in the NCAS
