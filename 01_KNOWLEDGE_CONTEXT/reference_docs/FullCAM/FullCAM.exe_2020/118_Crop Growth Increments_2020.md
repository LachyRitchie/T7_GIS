**Crop Growth Increments**

\[[Growth Properties](42_Growth%20Properties.htm) window (for crops and
pastures) : Any of the *Increments* buttons or the *Die Off* button\]

This [Time Series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) is one of the
following two crop and pasture time series windows, where you specify
the:

**1. Growth** of the crop or pasture as either:

- Mass increments of the specified crop or pasture components \[tdm/ha\]
- NPP flows to various crop or pasture components \[tdm/ha\].

**2. Die off**, for perennial pastures only, as either:

- Mass decrements of leaf components \[tdm/ha\]
- NPP flows from leaf components \[tdm/ha\].

**Details**

Crops and pastures may be grown via three different methods:

*Sigmoidal* (for annual species) - growth will begin from the planting
event and proceed to the harvest event, tracking along a sigmoidal
curve. At the time of harvest, the plant will have reached optimal
growth, which is the amount specified within the increment growth
window. This value should normally be an annual value.

*Perennial growth* (for perennial/multi-year species) - growth will
begin at time of planting from an initial standing dry matter amount,
and proceed using monthly increments and decrements. Perennial growth
can be used to accurately model seasonal variations and climatic impacts
on pasture yields.

*Linear* - growth will begin from the planting event and proceed to the
harvest event, tracking linearly from planting to harvest. At the time
of harvest, the plant will have reached optimal growth, which is the
amount specified within the increment growth window. This value should
normally be an annual value. Linear growth is not recommended for
modelling plant growth as it produces unrealistic amounts of biomass at
any point along the growth time series.

Additional detail and reference material on sigmoidal and perennial
growth methods can be found within Australia\'s National Inventory
Report.

**Additional Comments**

Crop and pasture growth within FullCAM does not take into account
climatic variability. It will simply model growth along a set curve to
reach the optimal yield as entered. The yields that are entered into
FullCAM should include climatic impacts into their modelling or
measurement prior to insertion into FullCAM.
