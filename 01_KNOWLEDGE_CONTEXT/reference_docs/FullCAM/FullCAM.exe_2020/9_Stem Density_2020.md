**Stem Density**

\[[Plant Properties](43_Plant%20Properties.htm) window : *Stem Density*
button\]

This is a [Time Series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) to
facilitate entering the stem density of a tree species.

**Details**

FullCAM uses masses for all its calculations, so stem density is only
used to convert between stem masses and stem volumes. Stem density is
required if:

- Modelling is of a multilayer forest and any of the following:
  - Tree growth is specified by stem volume increments;
  - The amount of stem material is specified by volume in the initial
    conditions; or
  - The amount of stem material in any tree planting is specified by
    volume.

See the *Properties of the Species Time Series* section of [Growth
Properties](42_Growth%20Properties.htm).

If only the trees are modelled, the plant age used in the stem density
time series is the maximum age of the plants (there are no events in
this configuration, so the maximum and average ages are the same).

Because the stem density is a time series, it may vary with the age of
the tree (set *Years are* to "Years since plants sprouted") or with the
year (set *Years are* to "Calendar years" or "Years since start of
simulation").

The stem density is of the whole stem at the time indicated, not of the
new stem growth in that year. The units are kilograms per cubic metre
(note: most other masses in FullCAM are in tonnes).

The density of stem wood is typically between 300--1,000 kgdm/m^3^. A
compendium of wood densities for Australian tree species can be found in
the NCAS Technical Report No. 18.

Typical values for native forest communities are described in Table 7 of
*Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Land Use Change in Australia: An
Integrated Application of the National Carbon Accounting System*.
Additional species specific values can be extracted from the FullCAM
database.
