**Event Update**

\[*Events* page : *Clone Events* or *Event Update* dialogues\]

[Event Timing](143_Event%20Timing.htm) can be updated for multiple
events at once. This can be either a positive or negative offset from
the current timing, and is irrespective of the type (Calendar date or
Days since start of simulation).

When moving an event with a negative offset, the regime which the event
belongs to will reorganise itself by changing the year of events so that
the regime always begins after the last data of the previous regime.

[Event Timing](143_Event%20Timing.htm) may be updated for multiple
events by multi-selecting the events on the Event List, and then
selecting either of the right mouse options:

*Apply Offset to Events*- Updates the selected [Events](136_Events.htm)
timing details by the offset years and days specified.

*Clone Events*- Clones the selected events and applies an offset to the
original events of the years and days specified. This can be
particularly useful if you wish to clone [Regimes](235_Regimes.htm).
