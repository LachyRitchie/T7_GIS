**Graph Axes**

\[[Output Window](168_Output%20Window.htm) : Double-click on graph to
open the *Graph Settings* window : *Axes* page\]

Choose the properties of the graph axes of an *Output Window*.

**Details**

*Major ticks* are the larger marks along the axis. Major ticks are
usually labelled with a number. Gridlines, which are lines across the
whole graph, can occur at major ticks.

*Minor ticks* are the smaller marks along the axis. Minor ticks are not
labelled and do not have gridlines.

To set the scale manually, choose the *Manual* button in the *Scale*
area, then enter numbers for the five scale parameters. You can copy the
current graph scale parameters to the editing boxes by pressing the
*Load Current Graph Values* button. The *Minimum* and *Maximum* values
are the starting and finishing values of the axis. The *Major tick unit*
is the change in value of the axis parameter between consecutive major
tick marks. Similarly for minor ticks. The *Ticks start at* value is the
value at which both the major and minor tick marks start (and continue
thereafter), and must be equal to or slightly less than the minimum
value.
