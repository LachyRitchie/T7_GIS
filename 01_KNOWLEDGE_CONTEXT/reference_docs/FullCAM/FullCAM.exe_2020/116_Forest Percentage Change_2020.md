**Forest Percentage Change**

\[[Event Window](137_Event%20Window.htm) : *Forest Percentage Change*
panel\]

Enter the inputs specific to a forest-percentage change event.

**Details**

Enter the [Forest Percentage](206_Forest%20Percentage.htm) that will
apply to the plot, until the next forest percentage change event. See
[Initial Conditions For the Whole
Plot](197_Initial%20Conditions%20For%20the%20Whole%20Plot.htm).

Forest percentage change events with no valid choice are shown as a
simulating event in the event list (so you can change their type), but
are shown as not ready and have no effect on the simulation.

**Equal to a Constant**

This is the recommended way to adjust the forest percentage when using
the default parameters available from downloaded data. The forest
percentage will be changed to the specified value and will not change
until a subsequent forest change event occurs.

Note that the Forest Percentage Change does not automatically respond to
events that plant or remove trees. A forest percentage change event
should always be created alongside another event that purports to change
land management practices and/or influence the presence of a forest,
consistent with the events created from [new
regimes](274_New%20Regime.htm).

**Determined by the Tree Yield Formula**

Under this option the forest percentage rises from 0% at planting to
100% at the age of maximum growth. This relies on the evidence that the
age of maximum growth is at or near the age of canopy closure. The
growth determined by the tree yield formula is not affected by the
forest percentage, but the tree growth affects how much room is left for
pasture between the trees.

**Note**: Under this option, in simulation steps where the tree yield
formula is not in use, the forest percentage is equal to the constant
forest percentage entered in the initial conditions.

**Determined by the Tree Age**

It may be used with or without the tree yield formula.

**Note**: Under this option, in simulation steps where the tree yield
formula happens to not be in use, the forest percentage is equal to the
constant forest percentage entered in the initial conditions. This is
similar to the linking of canopy closure and age of maximum growth in
the previous option but lets the user set the age of canopy closure
manually.
