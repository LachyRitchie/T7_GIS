**Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) Modifier**

\[[Site : Water](12_Site_Water.htm) window : *VPD Modifier* button\]

This [Time Series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) is where you
specify the VPD modifier (modVPD) used by
[3PG](http://www.fullcam.au/FullCAMServer2020/Help/115_3PG.htm)-lite.

**Details**

This time series is only used if the [Forest Productivity Index
(FPI)](188_Forest%20Productivity%20Index.htm) is computed from scratch
and the [Soil Water Modifier](183_Soil%20Water%20Modifier.htm) is
computed by
[3PG](http://www.fullcam.au/FullCAMServer2020/Help/115_3PG.htm)-lite ---
see [Configure Tree Production](108_Configure%20Tree%20Production.htm).

The VPD modifier is dimensionless, greater than 0, and usually less
than 1. Higher values result in more NPP being produced by the trees.

The VPD modifier is restricted to values between 0 and 1.
