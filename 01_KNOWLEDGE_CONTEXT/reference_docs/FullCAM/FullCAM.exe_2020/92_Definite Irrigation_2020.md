**Definite Irrigation**

\[[Site : Water](12_Site_Water.htm) window : *Definite Irrigation*
button (*Forest* or *Agricultural*)\]

This [Time Series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) is where you
enter irrigation that definitely occurs (does not depend on conditions),
in millimetres (100 mm = 1 megalitre per hectare).

The window is also a typical time series window provided that irrigation
was specified to occur as a time series in the 'Events or Time Series'
window of the 'Configuration tab'. If irrigation was specified as
events, then irrigation events need to be added to the 'Events' tab.

**Details**

This time series is only used when the *Irrigation* setting on the
[Configure Event Or Time
Series](195_Configure%20event%20or%20time-series.htm) window is set to
*Time series*.

See [Site : Water](12_Site_Water.htm).
