### Overview of FullCAM

An overview of what FullCAM can do.

### Introduction

FullCAM is a model for tracking the greenhouse gas emissions and changes
in stocks of carbon and nitrogen associated with land use and
management. FullCAM is a fully integrated Carbon Accounting Model (CAM)
for estimating and predicting all biomass, litter and soil carbon pools
in forest and agricultural systems. In addition, it accounts for changes
in major greenhouse gases, nitrogen cycling and human-induced land use
practices.

FullCAM is the model used to construct Australia\'s national greenhouse
gas emissions account for the land sector. Users of the model can
determine project-based results on a similar basis to Australia\'s
official recording of greenhouse emissions trends for land use and land
use change.

FullCAM was developed to integrate data on land cover change, land use
and management, climate, plant productivity, and soil carbon over time
to provide a dynamic account of the changing stock of carbon in
Australia\'s land systems since 1970.

FullCAM incorporates a suite of verifiable component models, adapted for
use at a fine spatial (25 m) and temporal (monthly) resolution for the
Australian continent, including:

- [CAMFor](77_CAMFor.htm) -- for forest systems
- [CAMAg](78_CAMAg.htm) -- for cropping and grazing systems
- [RothC](114_RothC.htm) -- for agricultural soil carbon

FullCAM can run each of these sub-models in isolation or in combination.
See [Constituent Models In
FullCAM](198_Constituent%20Models%20In%20FullCAM.htm).

The sub-models used within FullCAM can be integrated into various
combinations to suit the data available and outputs required. FullCAM
may be used for tracking of carbon and nitrogen stocks and flows in
different forest and agricultural systems, and can also be used more
simply to review project-based results for small land holdings.

Specifically, FullCAM calculates the carbon and nitrogen flows
associated with:

- Forests, including the wood products made from wood harvested from the
  forest. It calculates the carbon in the trees, debris, mulch, soils,
  and wood products, and the carbon and nitrogen exchanged with the
  atmosphere, due to thinnings, multiple rotations, and fires.
- Agricultural systems, which can be cropped or grazed systems. FullCAM
  calculates the carbon and nitrogen in the plants, debris, mulch, soil,
  and products, and the carbon and nitrogen exchanged with the
  atmosphere, while including the effects of harvest, ploughing, fire,
  herbicides, and grazing.
- Afforestation and reforestation systems, which are represented and
  modelled as transitions from agricultural systems to forests.
- Deforestation systems, which are represented and modelled as
  transitions from forests to agricultural systems.
- Mixed systems (such as in agroforestry) -- assorted combinations of
  the systems above.

FullCAM calculates the carbon and nitrogen stocks and flows (including
the effect of nitrogen shortages on plant growth) for land subject to
different land use and management activities.

FullCAM also has the ability to calculate the fossil fuel displacement
values by use of wood or agricultural products (including bioenergy).
For instance, if forests or crops are used for bioenergy (energy derived
from burning them or their residues), FullCAM can calculate how much
fossil fuel based energy emissions this would equal (given 1 tonne of
biomass burned approximates to x kilojoules of fossil fuel emissions).
This gives users a better understanding of the relative impacts of their
land use practices on greenhouse emission levels.

FullCAM can also be used to review project-based results for small land
holdings.

### Main Function

The main function of FullCAM is to model the stocks and flows of carbon
and nitrogen in mixed forest and agricultural systems. This includes
tracking carbon and nitrogen within pure agricultural and forestry
systems, as well as within transitions from an agricultural activity to
a forestry activity or agroforestry system (and vice versa), and taking
into account how these systems and their proportional contributions
change over time. FullCAM models all carbon and nitrogen pools, plus
interchanges and fluxes within the:

- Plants
- Debris
- Soil
- Products
- Atmosphere

FullCAM tracks the movement of carbon, from its removal from the
atmosphere through the growth of plants, all the way through to its
return to the atmosphere -- after potentially passing through plants,
debris, soil, grazing animals or wood or agricultural products.

FullCAM can model carbon in up to:

- Six tree components
- Five crop components
- Twelve forest debris and ten agricultural debris components
- Six forest soil and six agricultural soil components
- Forest products
- Agricultural products.

FullCAM can be configured into many different models, and there are
hundreds of outputs to choose from. FullCAM can model different tree and
crop species, and also can account for changes in carbon due to
management events such as plantings, thinning, harvest, fire, grazing,
and ploughing.

**Capabilities**

- [Plot Simulation](177_Plot%20Simulation.htm) tracks all the carbon
  associated with a plot, both on the plot and in the products produced
  by the plot
- [Estate Simulation](72_Estate%20Simulation.htm). An estate is an
  arbitrary collection of plots, each with its own area.
