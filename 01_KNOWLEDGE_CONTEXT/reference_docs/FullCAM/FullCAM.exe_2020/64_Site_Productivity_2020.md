**Site : Productivity**

\[[Site](200_Site.htm) page : *Productivity* button\]

Enter information about the productivity of the plot.

**Use**

"Soil fertility rating" and "Soil nutrition modifier" are on this window
in the [Site](200_Site.htm) page rather than on the [Soil](203_Soil.htm)
page because they represent general properties of the site and its soil,
rather than properties due entirely to soil characteristics.

The forest productivity index (FPI) is required when the tree yield
formula is used to compute tree production, and the FPI is not computed
from scratch by FullCAM --- see [Configure Tree
Production](108_Configure%20Tree%20Production.htm).
