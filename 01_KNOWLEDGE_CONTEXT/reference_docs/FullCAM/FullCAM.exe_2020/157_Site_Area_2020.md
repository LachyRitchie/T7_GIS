**Site : Area**

\[[Site](200_Site.htm) page : *Area* panel\]

Enter information about the area of the plot.

**Use**

Choose either:

1.  No Area - The plot model is a *point* model --- it has no area, but
    represents a typical hectare. Output masses are reported in tonnes
    per hectare.
2.  Area - The plot is a piece of land with a specified area. Output
    masses are reported in tonnes.

The choice only affects the way the outputs are reported. Relative to
the *No area* choice, the outputs under the *Area* choice are multiplied
by the specified area in hectares (for appropriate outputs).

**Example**. Suppose that when you choose *No Area* the mass of carbon
in the trees after a simulation is 20 t/ ha. If you change your choice
to *Area* and specify the area as 7 hectares, when you rerun the
simulation the reported mass of carbon in the trees will be 140 t (20 t/
ha \* 7 ha = 140 t).

If economic modelling is on (see [Configure Other
Options](138_Configure%20Other%20Options.htm)), then the \"Area\" option
is automatically chosen and you will need to have a valid area (enter 1
hectare as the area if you effectively want the output masses to be
\"per hectare\").
