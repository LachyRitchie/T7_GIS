**Yield and NPP**

Yield and NPP are related concepts and you will need to know how they
are defined in order to understand plant growth in FullCAM.

**Turnover**

A plant is normally "turning over" or shedding material, producing
"litterfall" aboveground and "root slough" belowground.

**NPP**

The net increase in plant mass due to the addition of new plant material
is called the *net primary production* (NPP), which includes the effects
of both photosynthesis and respiration. NPP is difficult to measure due
to the confounding effect of *turnover* (in which all plant components
except tree stems lose portions via turnover), and is of interest mainly
to people tracking tree physiology.

NPP is due to the combined effects of photosynthesis and respiration.
The mass added by photosynthesis is called *gross primary production*
(GPP). It is photosynthesis that removes carbon from the atmosphere and
adds it to the plant. However, much of the GPP is promptly lost (and
carbon returned to the atmosphere) due to respiration. In trees, NPP is
typically about half of GPP. In FullCAM, NPP is measured in tonnes per
hectare.

Thus, in normal growth, a plant is simultaneously adding to its mass by
the process of production (which adds NPP to the plant) and losing mass
by the process of turnover (which loses material from the plant).

**Yield**

Due to the turnover of plant components, when we measure the change in
component mass over a period of time we actually measure the *yield*,
which is the NPP less the turnover. Yield is relatively easy to measure
and is of interest to anyone who measures plant masses.

The yield of a plant is the NPP produced less the material shed by
turnover: in any given period,

*Yield = NPP -- Turnover*.

**Use NPP or Yield?**

NPP is due to production, material-turned-over is due to turnover, and
yield is due to the combined effects of production and turnover.

There are two fundamentally different ways of specifying or measuring
plant growth:

1.  By yield changes --- changes in yield with time.
2.  By NPP flows --- amounts of NPP added to the plant component.

In practice, the material-turned-over is hard to measure precisely as
material moving to debris via turnover is quickly dispersed into the
environment, while yields are relatively easy to measure precisely.

The yield is what you get if you simply measure the mass of the
specified plant component(s), and a "mass increment" (or "yield
increment") is the difference in measurements of mass over the period of
the increment.

For example, if you measure the leaves of the trees of a forest as 20
tdm/ha on June 1 then the yield of the tree leaves on June 1 is 20
tdm/ha. If you then measure the leaves of the trees as 26 tdm/ha on
August 1, the mass increment of the tree leaves is 6 tdm/ha over those
two months. If your increment time series contained monthly leaf mass
increments, then it might have 3 tdm/ha in June and another 3 tdm/ha in
July.

An NPP flow to a tree or crop component in a given period is the mass of
NPP that is added to the component in the period.

For example, continuing the previous example, suppose that the trees
shed 1 tdm/ha of leaves during June and a further 2 tdm/ha of leaves in
July. Then the NPP flowing to the leaves in June must have been 4 tdm/ha
(the leaf mass increment was 3 tdm/ha in June, which included shedding 1
tdm/ha of leaves) and in July must have been 5 tdm/ha (3 tdm/ha net
gain, including a 2 tdm/ha loss). If your increment time series
contained monthly leaf NPP flows, then it would have 4 tdm/ha in June
and another 5 tdm/ha in July.
