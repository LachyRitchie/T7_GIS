This window is for viewing and editing a table. See also [Find Request
in a
Table](http://www.fullcam.au/FullCAMServer2020/Help/59_Find%20Request%20in%20a%20Table.htm).

**Overview**

The smallest lump of information that always stays together is shown in
the table as a single row, and is called a *record*.

This window has a *table grid*, which shows the whole table, one record
per line.

Some tables also come with a *detailed view*, which shows one record in
complete detail on a panel in the right hand side of the window. If
there is a detailed view, you can move the navy blue dividing line
between the table grid and the detailed view by grabbing it with the
mouse.

**Table**

The row in purple is the row that is currently being edited (and if
there is a detailed view, the row shown in the detailed view). The light
bands of colouring on every fifth row is to help guide your eye across
large tables.

The table is very flexible:

- Resize the columns by moving the column dividers in the title row.
- Change the column order by grabbing them in the title row and moving
  them.

The table can be operated mainly from the keyboard:

- Press the *Tab* key to go the next cell
- Press *Shift + Tab* to go to the previous cell.
- Use the up and down arrow keys to move to cells above and below the
  current cell being edited.
- Use the *Enter* key also moves you to the cell below.

**Sorting**

Press the Sort button on the tool bar to sort the visible records by the
leftmost table columns (sort by the leftmost column, use the next
leftmost column to break ties, and so on). Change the column order by
grabbing and moving them in order to get the exact sort that you want.

You can also sort the table by double-clicking on the title of a column.
Ties in that column are resolved in the standard order for that table.
