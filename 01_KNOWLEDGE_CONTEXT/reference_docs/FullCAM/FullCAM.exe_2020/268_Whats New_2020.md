What\'s New?

### 

New in the 2020 pre-release

A number of changes have been included in the 2020 pre-release following
consultation on the 2019 pre-release. These changes include:

**Improvements to the FullCAM user interface**

**Including climate data for 2018**

**Correcting to the timing of events in a number of regimes, which
automate events common to some types of simulations**

**Reverting to the treatment of forest fires to the treatment in the
current FullCAM (prior to 2019), pending further data acquisition**\
*This has delayed the use of the standing dead pool for the incidence of
fire*

**Modifying the method for projecting the [Forest Productivity
Index](188_Forest%20Productivity%20Index.htm), to avoid the potential
for climate data for a single year to cause excessive variability in
biomass estimates over time**
