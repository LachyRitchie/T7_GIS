Pasture to Plantation Forest

Details

Pasture to plantation forest management systems are created in FullCAM
by using a plot type of *Multilayer mixed system*.

Other systems that may be created by FullCAM are:

[Plantation Forest to Plantation
Forest](229_Plantation%20Forest%20to%20Plantation%20Forest.htm)\
[Native Forest to Plantation
Forest](230_Native%20Forest%20to%20Plantation%20Forest.htm)\
[Native Forest to Pasture](231_Native%20Forest%20to%20Pasture.htm)\
[Grazed Woodland](232_Grazed%20Woodland.htm)\
[Crop and Pasture Management](233_Crop%20and%20Pasture%20Management.htm)

**Method**

*Configuration*

- Plot Type : Multilayer mixed system.

*Timing*

- *Start simulation at beginning of* year should be set to 20 years
  prior to plantation establishment.

It is always prudent to 'run the model in' by setting the start year
earlier (up to 20 years) than the actual period of interest. This is
because the soil carbon data at initialisation represents a pristine
condition, a condition that does not reflect any prior management.

*Build the Event Queue*

- Set the *Forest percentage for downloading* to 0.\
  Select the required *Crop species* (refer [Downloading Spatial
  Data](207_Downloading%20Spatial%20Data.htm)).\
  Select the required *Trees species*.
- Select an initial *Crop Regime* (refer [Events](136_Events.htm)).
- Select a subsequent rotation *Tree-species plantation regime.*

Additional tree and crop species can be added to model transitions from
one plantation species to another.
