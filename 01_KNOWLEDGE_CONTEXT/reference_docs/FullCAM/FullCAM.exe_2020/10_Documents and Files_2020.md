**Documents and Files**

This topic is about using documents and files in FullCAM.

**Document Types**

FullCAM has two document types:

**1. Plot document**\
Represents an area of land with uniform characteristics. Masses are in
tonnes per hectare if there is no area, or in tonnes if you input an
area. Saved in a file extension of ".plo". See [Plot
Simulation](177_Plot%20Simulation.htm).

**2. Estate document**\
Represents an "estate", which is arbitrary collection of plots each with
its own area. Masses are in tonnes. Saved in a file extension of ".est".
See [Estate Simulation](72_Estate%20Simulation.htm).

The main type of document are plots --- for modelling forests and
agriculture regions on a single homogeneous area. Estates add areas to
plots, allowing you to combine multiple plots to model an heterogeneous
area --- such as for modelling a series of plantation forest stands.

**A Document Can Have Multiple Windows**

A document may have more than one window:

- There is always one window active for entering your inputs (the *input
  window*).
- You may create as many output windows as you require.

In FullCAM, you can have multiple graphs or tables for a simulation all
visible at once.

In addition, FullCAM can open any number of documents at once. So you
might have multiple documents open, each with multiple windows open.

A list of all open FullCAM documents can be viewed at the bottom of the
drop down menu when the document item in the main menu is selected or
alternatively in the document drop down list in the toolbar of FullCAM
main window. By selecting a document from either of these locations.

The *Window* menu on the [Main Window](217_Main%20Window.htm) allows you
to manage the windows individually, on a window by window basis.
