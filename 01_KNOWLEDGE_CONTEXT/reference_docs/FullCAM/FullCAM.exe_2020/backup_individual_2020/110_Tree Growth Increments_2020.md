This Time Series Window is one of the tree increment time series windows, where growth of the trees is specified as either:

- Volume increments of stems [m3/ha]
- Mass increments of various tree components [tdm/ha]
- NPP flows to various tree components [tdm/ha].

**Details**

Stems have no turnover, so NPP flows to the stems are equal to the yield increments of the stems.

Stem volume increments are converted to stem mass increments by multiplying by the Stem Density.
