The following keys have special meanings that are not necessarily
apparent from looking through the menus. You do not need to know any of
these meanings to use FullCAM with a mouse and the usual keys, but these
meanings can speed you up.

**Enter** - If you are in a number entry box, FullCAM immediately
processes the number.

**Tab** --- Jumps to the next data entry control (box, menu, button, and
so on).

**Shift-Tab** --- Jumps to the previous data entry control (box, menu,
button, and so on).

**Space** --- If a button is selected, pressing the *Space* bar presses
the button.

**Home, End, Page Up, Page Down** --- Move between pages in tabbed
windows (such as the document input windows), move between help topics
in the *Help* window, and move between records in the table windows.

**Delete** --- Deletes selected items from lists.

**F1** --- Opens the *Help* window at the help topic for the current
window. If there are several help buttons on the window, pressing F1
opens the Help at the topic for the first of the buttons --- you can
then move to other topics using control-N (next) and control-B (back).
However, in general we recommend you press the help button with the
mouse to move straight to the topic you want.

**F9** --- Simulates a plot or estate document (refer Introduction to
Using FullCAM for further
details).

**F12** --- Closes the window, automatically pressing any *OK* or *Done*
button on the window.

**Escape** --- Closes the window, automatically pressing any *Cancel*
button on the window. Same as if the close-window box was clicked.

**Alt** --- Shifts focus to the Main Window,
ready for a letter to choose a menu. A second *Alt* key press returns
you to the previous window.

**Underlines on buttons** --- If there is a button in the current window
with an underlined letter, pressing that "Alt-" and that letter on the
keyboard presses that button (if there is no ambiguity due to currently
being in a text box and so on, just pressing the letter on the keyboard
has the same effect).
