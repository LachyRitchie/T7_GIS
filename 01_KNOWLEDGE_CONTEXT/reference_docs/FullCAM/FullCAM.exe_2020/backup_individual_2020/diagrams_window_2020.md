\ page : *Diagrams* button\]

Selecting the \'Diagrams\...\' button shows diagrams of the FullCAM
model, for the current configuration. The diagrams show the pools,
layers, and systems in your plot (see ), and the flows
of material that occur.

**Diagrams**

Press the Diagrams button to see diagrams of the chosen configuration
(when the Configuration page is complete)

**Current limitations**

The diagrams show:

1.  Processes --- Processes are the continuous actions that occur all
    the time, such as production or decomposition.
2.  Carbon flows..
3.  Layers --- A layer is a collection of similar pools, such as trees,
    crops, debris, mulch, soil, or products.

**Use**

Choose the layer or system from the menu to the left of the toolbar. You
may need to resize the window or scroll to see all of the diagram.

The options button to the right of the diagram menu controls some
options on how the diagrams are displayed. In particular, the *Show
Names* option switches on the display of programming names on the
diagrams, which is useful when reading the FullCAM technical
documentation.

**Legend**

The smallish coloured rectangles are pools. The grey rectangles around
them are the layers. Some of the pools in a layer may be grouped by
function with a coloured rectangle within their layer, for example the
aboveground debris pools form the "litter".

The black lines show carbon flow. There is always an arrow at the end of
the flow, to indicate the direction of flow. Where two carbon flows
merge to become a single flow (like the flow of water at the junction of
two rivers), the black lines have a black dot. If two black lines cross
over one another without a black dot then the two flows are separate
(they do not join).

The small light blue circles are splitters, which are where a carbon
flow splits into more several flows. The proportions of material that
flow each way out of a splitter are controlled by inputs that you set in
the FullCAM inputs.

The names of the processes causing each flow are in blue. The names of
the inputs and outputs to each layer are in purple.

**Printing**

You may print the diagrams by clicking the *Page setup* and *Print*
icons. General Help regarding these functions is available from within
the dialog boxes. Specific options for the *Print what* option in the
*Page setup* dialog are as follows:

1.  **Displayed diagram**. In this case FullCAM will just print the
    diagram that is currently displayed.
2.  **All diagrams**. All diagrams are printed in sequence. Each diagram
    commences on a new page. When using *Print preview*, repeated
    clicking of the *Close* button moves on to the next diagram until
    the last one is reached.

To cancel the preview at the currently displayed diagram, close the
*Print preview* window by clicking the Close icon that is located on the
window title bar.
