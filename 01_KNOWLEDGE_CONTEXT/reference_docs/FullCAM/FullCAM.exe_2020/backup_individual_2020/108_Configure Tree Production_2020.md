Specify how the production of new tree material should be calculated.

**Method**

Choose a tree growth method:

- *Increments* - FullCAM will use time series of volume or mass
  increments of new growth, by calendar year or by tree age. Data must
  be supplied in the [Growth Properties](42_Growth%20Properties.htm)
  window.
- *Tree yield formula* - Uses an empirical biomass yield equation, the
  [Tree Yield Formula](130_Tree%20Yield%20Formula.htm), to calculate
  tree growth.
