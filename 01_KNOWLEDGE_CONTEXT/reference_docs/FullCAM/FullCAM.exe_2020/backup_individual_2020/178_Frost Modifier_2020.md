This time series is only used if the forest productivity index is
computed from scratch **and** the frost modifier is input directly (that
is, it is not computed by 3PG-lite) --- see Configure Tree
Production.

The frost modifier is dimensionless, and between 0 and 1. Higher values
result in more NPP being produced by the trees. A value of 1 implies no
frost, and 0 implies no NPP is produced.
