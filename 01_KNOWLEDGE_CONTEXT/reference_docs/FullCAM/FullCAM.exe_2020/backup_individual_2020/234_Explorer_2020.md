This page shows inputs required by the current configuration showing
names, programming names and values for FullCAM inputs.

The values are the current values in the document. If the value is blank
or the value is not a number or "On/Off", or if there is no such value
in that type of document, generally no value is shown. It is possible
that some inputs will be shown that are not required because of other
(non-configuration) settings - for example, in a forest configuration
the tree mortality inputs will be shown as required regardless of
whether or not the *Tree mortality on* box is checked on the Plant
Properties window for any species.

The programming names are useful if you are reading the FullCAM
technical documentation.

**Use**

The Window can be used as an alternate view of a document to get the
feel for the data required for a simulation and to allow browsing of all
the values of the document.

Drag and drop via Explorer is also provided to other FullCAM plot
windows, functionality such as Plot Digest for
input selection, or external applications such as Microsoft Word and
Excel for exporting the selected document data.
