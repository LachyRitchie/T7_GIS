This topic is about the items on the *Simulate* menu.

**Run Simulation**

Select *Run Plot Simulation* to run a simulation on the current
document. The type of simulation depends on the current document type:

| Document Type | Simulation Type   |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Plot          | plot simulation   |
| Estate        | estate simulation |

If multiple plots and /or estates are open when *Run Plot Simulation* is
selected only the active (front most) plot estate is simulated.

**Simulation Reports**

These reports provide some statistics on the last simulation, and the
plot simulations since you last started FullCAM.

The *Report Subrule for Last Simulation* menu option creates a Subrule
Report. This menu option is only available when the Subrule
Report conditions are satisfied.
