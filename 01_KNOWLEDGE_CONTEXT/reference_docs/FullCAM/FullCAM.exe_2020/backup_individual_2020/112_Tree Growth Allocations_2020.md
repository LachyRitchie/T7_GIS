This Time Series Window is one of the tree allocation time series windows, where you specify the relative allocations of yield or NPP (see Yield and Net Primary Production) to the six tree components: stems, branches, bark, leaves, coarse roots, or fine roots.

**Introduction**

The allocations determine the growth of a component, relative to the other components. A high allocation means more growth of the component compared to the other components, a low allocation means the component grows slower than the other components. Hence, allocations are purely relative: it is not the size of the numbers by themselves that matters, only the ratios between the allocations to the various tree components.

Typically the stem (or bole) growth is the frame of reference, and the mass increases of the other components relative to the stems are recorded. If the relative stem growth is set to 1.0, then where the leaf mass increment is a half of the stem mass increment it would be set to 0.5.

Data on allocations to various tree components can be found in the NCAS Technical Reports 5a, 5b, 17, 25 and 44 (17 is the synthesis report). Recent revisions are reported by Paul and Roxburgh (2017 & 2019).

General values for major vegetation types can be found in Table 3 of the report *Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Land Use Change in Australia: Results of the National Carbon Accounting System 1988â€“2001*. Additional species specific allocations can be extracted from the FullCAM database.
