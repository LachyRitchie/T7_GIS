This Time Series Window is where you
specify the VPD modifier (modVPD) used by
3PG-lite.

**Details**

This time series is only used if the Forest Productivity Index
(FPI) is computed from scratch
and the Soil Water Modifier is
computed by
3PG-lite ---
see Configure Tree Production.

The VPD modifier is dimensionless, greater than 0, and usually less
than 1. Higher values result in more NPP being produced by the trees.

The VPD modifier is restricted to values between 0 and 1.
