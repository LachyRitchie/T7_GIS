This time series is only used if the forest productivity index is
computed from scratch **and** the soil water modifier is input directly
(that is, it is not computed by 3PG-lite) --- see Configure Tree
Production.

The soil water modifier is dimensionless, greater than 0, and usually
less than 1. Higher values result in more NPP being produced by the
trees.

The soil water modifier is restricted to values between 0 and 1.
