This Time Series Window is where you
specify the carbon mass of plant residues from the debris and mulch that
enter the soil, in tonnes per hectare.

**Details**

FullCAM automatically calculates these inputs in multilayer plot models
that include the soil (Configure the
Plot), so this input is only required
when the soil is being modelled on its own.
