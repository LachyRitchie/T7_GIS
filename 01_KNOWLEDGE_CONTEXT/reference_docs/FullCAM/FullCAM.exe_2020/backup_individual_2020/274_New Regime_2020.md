**Use**

The "New Regime" panel enables addition of new events to the "Events
List".

**Select Regime**

Of the species that have been downloaded, any of the default regimes
governing the typical planting, removing and management of the species
may be selected from the "Regime" selection drop-down list. The start
date, repeat period and end dates can be adjusted to suit the intended
modelling.

**Regime Name**

Regimes built from this tool can be given custom identifiers which will
appear in the regime column of the *Events* tab.
