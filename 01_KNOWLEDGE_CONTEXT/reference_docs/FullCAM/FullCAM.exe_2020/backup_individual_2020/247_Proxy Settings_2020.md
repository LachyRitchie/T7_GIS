This window is for maintaining your FullCAM proxy settings.

**Use System Default Proxy**

This setting causes FullCAM to use the system default proxy which is
specified in Control Panel -> Internet Options -> Connections -> LAN
Settings.

If your LAN uses automatic configuration to set the proxy server, you
must manually configure that proxy server in FullCAM.

This is the default setting for Proxy.

**Use a Manually Configured Proxy**

This option allows you to specify the address and port of the proxy that
should be used. Type the proxy server name in the Address text box and
the port number in the Port text box.

**Do Not Use a Proxy**

This option allows you to connect directly to the Departmental
Server overriding any system default
proxy.

Please note that changes to your proxy settings will not take effect
until the next time that you connect.
