---title: Sensitivity of Debris Breakdown to Temperature and Waterversion: 2020category: debrisoriginal_file: 122_Sensitivity of Debris Breakdown to Temperature and Water_2020.md---Specify how the breakdown rates of the debris increase with increasingtemperature and water.**Introduction**You can choose either of both of two styles of sensitivity:Mulch style.Soil style (as in RothC).The mulch layer always has temperature and water sensitivity: the mulchdecomposition rates increase with increasing temperature and rainfall.Turning on mulch-style sensitivity will cause the debris breakdown layerto behave with mulch-like responses to conditions. Mulch-stylesensitivity can be used to provide a more mulch-like simulation, ifrequired.The soil layer always has temperature and water sensitivity: the soildecomposition rates increase with increasing temperature and decreasingtopsoil moisture deficit.All debris pools are always affected in the same manner. The samesensitivity factor applies to the breakdown rate of each debris pool.**No Sensitivity To Temperature or Water**If neither style of sensitivity is on, then the fraction of each debrispool lost due to breakdown is equal to the breakdown percentage for thepool (entered elsewhere on the window) adjusted to the relevant periodof time:> *g* = *M * L*,where*g* = mass of material lost from the pool due to breakdown in the timeperiod*M* = mass of the pool at the beginning of the time period*L* = fraction of mass in the pool at the beginning of the time periodthat is lost due to breakdown= 1 -- (1 -- *f*)\^*y**f* = breakdown fraction (fraction lost due to breakdown per year)= breakdown percentage of pool / 100*y* = number of years in time period.Note that *g*, *M*, and *L* are independent of temperature and water. 0 <= *f* <= 1.**Mulch-Style Sensitivity**If mulch-style sensitivity is on and soil-style sensitivity is off, thenyou must enter the sensitivity to temperature (*s*) and the sensitivityto water (*v*), which determine how sensitive the breakdown rates are.> *g* = *M * L* * [ 1 -- exp(--*s * T*) ] * [ 1 -- exp(--*v **W*) ]where*s* = the sensitivity of breakdown to temperature (*s* >= 0)*T* = the average air temperature (in deg C, negative temperatures-treated as zero for this purpose) during the time period (*T* >= 0),*v* = the sensitivity of breakdown to water (*v* >= 0)*W* = the total rainfall and irrigation (in mm) during the time period(*W* >= 0). Notice that both the temperature factor> 1 -- exp(--*s * T*)>and the water factor> 1 -- exp(--*v * W*)>are:> - Between 0 and 1> - Nearer 0 (less breakdown) as *T* and *W* fall or as *s* and *v* fall> - Nearer 1 (more breakdown) as *T* and W rise or as *s* and *v* rise.The overall rate of breakdown is quite sensitive to *s* and *v*. If *s*or *v* are too small then there is almost no breakdown; if *s* or *v*are too large then sensitivity is lost. As a very rough guide:- set *s* to about 1 / (average temperature in a simulation step)- set *v* to about 1 / (average rainfall-plus-irrigation during asimulation step).If mulch-style sensitivity is on, the rate of breakdown falls to zerowhen the average air temperature is at or below freezing or there is norainfal or irrigation specified.**Soil-Style Sensitivity**This option is only possible when the soil is modelled, because it usesthe topsoil moisture deficit in the soil and various RothC soil inputsto compute the rate of breakdown. If it is on then it will cause adifference to aboveground results when the soil is and is not includedin the model --- because if the soil is included in the model then thissensitivity is on but if the soil is not included then this sensitivityis off.If soil-style sensitivity is on and mulch-style sensitivity is off, thenyou do not need to enter any inputs: FullCAM uses the sensitivitydefined in the soil model (RothC), which does not haveany inputs exposed in the user-interface.> *g* = *M* * *L*,where*L* = fraction of mass in the pool at the beginning of the time periodthat is lost due to breakdown> = 1 -- (1 -- *f*)^(*y* * *a* * *b*)>*a* = rate modifier due to temperature> = 47.91 / (1 + exp0(106.06 / (18.27 + *T*)) for *T* > --5>0 for *T* <= --5>*b* = rate modifier due to water= 0.2 + 0.8 * (*e* -- TSMD) / (*h* * [(20 + 130 * *c* -- 100 * *c**c*) * (*d* / 23)])if version 26.3 of RothC in use1 / (1 + exp[ (TSMD -- (0.688405334 + 4.4746369 * *c* -- 3.44203 * *c**c*) * *d*)/ ((0.082530817 + 0.5364083 * *c* -- 0.41268 * *c**c*) * *d*) ])if version 26.5 of RothC in use*c* = clay fraction of soil*d* = sample depth of soil*h* = Ratio of the maximum TSMD when soil is bare to the maximum TSMDwhen soil is coveredTSMD = topsoil moisture deficit (as computed by RothC).Increasing *a* or *b* increases the effective time of decomposition, oreffectively increases the rate of decomposition during a given timeperiod. Increasing *T* or *W* increases *a* and *b* respectively(increasing *W* tends to increase the TSMD). 0 <= *a* <= 1 and 0 <=*b* <= 1.**Combined Mulch-Style and Soil-Style Sensitivity**If soil-style sensitivity and mulch-style sensitivity are both on thenFullCAM combines both styles of sensitivity.*g* = *M * L* * [ 1 -- exp(--*s * T*) ] * [ 1 -- exp(--*v * W*) ],where*L* = 1 -- (1 -- *f*)^(*y* * *a * b*)
