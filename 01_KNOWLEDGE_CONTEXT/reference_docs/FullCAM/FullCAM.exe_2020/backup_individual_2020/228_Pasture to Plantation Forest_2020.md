This isbecause the soil carbon data at initialisation represents a pristinecondition, a condition that does not reflect any prior management.*Build the Event Queue*- Set the *Forest percentage for downloading* to 0.Select the required *Crop species* (refer Downloading SpatialData).Select the required *Trees species*.- Select an initial *Crop Regime* (refer Events).- Select a subsequent rotation *Tree-species plantation regime.*Additional tree and crop species can be added to model transitions fromone plantation species to another.
