---title: Site Areaversion: 2020category: siteoriginal_file: 157_Site_Area_2020.md---Enter information about the area of the plot.**Use**Choose either:1.  No Area - The plot model is a *point* model --- it has no area, butrepresents a typical hectare. Output masses are reported in tonnesper hectare.2.  Area - The plot is a piece of land with a specified area. Outputmasses are reported in tonnes.The choice only affects the way the outputs are reported. Relative tothe *No area* choice, the outputs under the *Area* choice are multipliedby the specified area in hectares (for appropriate outputs).**Example**. Suppose that when you choose *No Area* the mass of carbonin the trees after a simulation is 20 t/ ha. If you change your choiceto *Area* and specify the area as 7 hectares, when you rerun thesimulation the reported mass of carbon in the trees will be 140 t (20 t/ha * 7 ha = 140 t).If economic modelling is on (see Configure OtherOptions), then the "Area" optionis automatically chosen and you will need to have a valid area (enter 1hectare as the area if you effectively want the output masses to be"per hectare").
