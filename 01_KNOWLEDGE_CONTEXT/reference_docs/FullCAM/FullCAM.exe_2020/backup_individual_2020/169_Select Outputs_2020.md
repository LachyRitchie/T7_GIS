Specify a set of FullCAM outputs for display by the accompanying output
window.

**Use**

There are about 800 possible outputs, but this window shows only those
outputs that are available in the configuration of the current document.

Single click on the icon or name of an output to select or deselect it.
Selected outputs are marked with a red tick.

The outputs are organised into folders, just like files are organised
into folders in Windows Explorer. Click on the plus (+) and minus (--)
buttons to expand and collapse the folders. A single click on the icon
or name of a folder selects or deselects everything within the folder.

The number of outputs is shown in a message at the bottom of the window.
Hover the mouse over the message with the number of outputs to find out
how many outputs are chosen but that are unavailable in this
configuration (they were chosen previously, while the plot was in a
different configuration).

Choosing flows and leaks as outputs slows down the simulation a little.
This slowness is only likely to be significant in simulations of large
estates.
