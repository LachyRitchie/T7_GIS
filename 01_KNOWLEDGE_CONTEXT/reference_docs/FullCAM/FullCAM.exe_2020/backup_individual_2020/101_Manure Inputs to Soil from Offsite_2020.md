This Time Series Window is where you specify the carbon mass (and maybe also the nitrogen mass) entering the soil from outside the plot, in tonnes per hectare.

**Details**

Manure from offsite (from outside the plot) may be added to the forest or agricultural soil.

In an agricultural system, manure from animals on the plot is dealt with by grazing --- see the Grazing Change events: plant material eaten by grazing animals becomes fodder, which may go to destinations including the DPM an RPM pools of the soil. This manure-from-offsite time series is the only explicit treatment of manure by FullCAM.

This time series is only used when the *Manure-From-Offsite Added to the Soil* setting on the Configure Event Or Time Series window is set to *Time series*.
