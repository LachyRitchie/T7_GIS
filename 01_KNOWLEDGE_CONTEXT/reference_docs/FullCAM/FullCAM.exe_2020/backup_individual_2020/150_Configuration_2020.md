---title: Configurationversion: 2020category: configurationoriginal_file: 150_Configuration_2020.md---This page is where you specify the configuration of your plot, bychoosing which parts of the plot should be modelled. This topicdescribes configuration issues in general terms; for more specifics see:Configure the Plot\Configure What ToSimulate\Configure Tree Production\Configure Other Options**About**This window allows users to view a list of all inputs (click on the'Models and Inputs'\... button) or a diagram showing all pools andfluxes of C (click on the 'Diagrams'\... button) for the modelconfiguration selected.**Models and Inputs**Clicking the 'Models and Inputs' button brings up a new window whichlists a variety of information for the model configuration selected. Thelevel of detail of information presented in this window can be specifiedusing the 'Options' button located at the far left of the menu bar forthis window. Additional menu bar buttons allow the user to copy andselect various components of the window, turn on word wrap if required,export the information in the window to a text file, find text and viewhelp file.Clicking the Options button and scrolling down to the 'Display' menuoption allows the user to specify the inputs that will be displayed inthe window. Options include:- All inputs: lists all inputs whether required or not for the currentconfiguration settings.- Inputs required by the current configuration: only displays inputsrequired by the current configuration.- Inputs required by the current configuration and other settings:displays inputs required by the current configuration plus additionalinformation pertaining to other events such as fire, plough,herbicide, grazing, irrigation, manure application, etc.The other three menu items on the Options button allow the user tospecify the nature of the information presented:*Show values*: presents the values entered into the various tabs andwindows to the right of the descriptor of each input (e.g. Carbon % offine roots = 38.4 %). If the value belongs to a species, it shows thevalue of the species that is currently selected for editing in theappropriate tab. If the value belongs to an event, the value shown comesfrom the chosen event of that type. No value is shown if there is nospecies or event or the value of the input is blank.*Show programming names*: presents the name assigned by FullCAMprogramming code for the variables in square brackets (e.g. Carbon % offine roots [CFracFirtA] = 38.4%). Programming names are useful if youare reading and referring to the FullCAM Function Specification.*Show configuration*: presents the user specified configuration for theplot as the first item in the information displayed. If anydiscrepancies exist between this list and the regular interface, theregular interface is correct.You can get help related to a specific input by placing the cursor inthe line in which the input is presented and clicking the 'Help forInput on Selected Line' button in the menu bar (Ctrl + i). General helppertaining to this window can be obtained by clicking on the 'Help'button in the menu bar (F1)**Configuration Determines Inputs**The configuration you choose will affect which inputs are required. Forexample, if you model a forest system only, then none of theagricultural inputs will be required. Or if 3PG is not used to modeltree production, the inputs that describe the net primary productivityof the forest are not required.You might want to experiment with different configurations in order todetermine the most configuration that most suits your needs, given theavailable inputs and your required outputs. To help in this process, foreach configuration you can see model diagrams (DiagramsWindow) and a list of required inputs(Models and Inputs Window).The plot input window only shows tabs for pages that have requiredinputs. On these pages, any inputs that are not required are dimmed(unavailable). To see which models use which inputs, change theconfiguration and any other relevant settings (such as turningirrigation on or off) and see if the input is still enabled.**FullCAM Integrates Its Constituent Models**All of the Constituent Models InFullCAM models areavailable, either independently or in combination.CAMFor and CAMAg are multilayerframework models. FullCAM allows you to run combinations of thesemodels, to simulate single or multilayer models (see Plots, Systems,Layers, and Pools),either forest or agricultural or mixed.**Readiness**When the *Configuration* page is unready and requiring more information:- The writing on the tab of the page is red.- Only the About, Configuration, andTiming tabbed pages appear in the input window ofthe document.When the *Configuration* page is ready (that is, complete):- The writing on the tab of the page is black.- If the *Timing* page is also ready then more than three tabbed pagesappear in the input window.While all the input pages use the red or black tab to indicateunreadiness (see General Features), onlythe *Configuration* page also controls which other tabbed pages appearin the document input window.**Simpler Is Usually Better**The more layers and the more sophisticated features you choose in yourmodel, the more difficult it will be to find all the required inputdata. We recommend:- Only modelling those layers and simulating those elements that youneed (in particular, do not model nitrogen unless necessary)- Restrict model configurations to those for which data is available andfor which the outputs are understandable.
