Describe the standing dead biomass pool present in the plot at the start
of the simulation.

The standing dead biomass pools are used to represent slower
decomposition of woody biomass that is either standing dead woody
biomass (for example following fire or drought) or freshly cut
post-clearing or harvesting (for example piled in wind-rows). Such
biomass is expected to slowly senesce at breakdown rates that are slower
than breakdown rates for debris pools (based on litterbag studies) that
have better contact with the soil and organisms that decompose biomass.

Standing dead pools turnover into debris (with some loss as carbon
dioxide) rather than turnover into soil as per debris pools (see
).

**Introduction**

All of the initial standing dead pool belongs to the initial tree
species, which is specified in the  window.

**Carbon Masses**

Enter the mass of carbon in the various standing dead pools, in tonnes
per hectare.

via the Trees or Crops buttons of the  page).
