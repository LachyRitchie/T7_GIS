Use the Data Builder to download data from the Departmental Server into your plot document.

For help downloading data, see Downloading Spatial Data.

**Introduction**

The Data Builder allows you to easily build plots by downloading the input data for your plot from the Departmental Server.

For further details and for assistance in building plots for complex systems, such as managed forest and agricultural mixes (agroforestry), please Contact Us.

Although the Data Builder has been designed for ease of use, it has advanced functionality that allows experienced users to build complex systems. Take care when downloading complex data or modifying downloaded data, as modelling errors can result.

**Internet Connection to the FullCAM Server**

Using the Data Builder requires that your computer be connected to the Internet. The Data Builder will automatically connect to the Departmental Server as required.

**Plot Configuration**

Your choice of plot type and location will affect the species and regime data offered for downloading. For example, Regimes including a transition from pasture to plantation are not available for a forest system because a pasture is modelled by an agricultural system.
