**Further Documentation**

This topic discusses available documentation beyond this Help system.

**Diagrams**

Press the *Diagrams* button on the
[Configuration](150_Configuration.htm) page to open the [Diagrams
Window](50_Diagrams%20Window.htm), which shows diagrams of your plot
model (as specified by the settings on the *Configuration* page).

**Papers and Methodology**

See the National Inventory Report for further discussion of the
methodologies and literature drawn upon by FullCAM:

Department of the Environment (2015) National Inventory Report 2013
Volume 1. Commonwealth of Australia 2015.

Department of the Environment (2015) National Inventory Report 2013
Volume 2. Commonwealth of Australia 2015.

**National Carbon Accounting System Technical Reports**

Supporting technical documentation is provided in the National Carbon
Accounting System Technical Reports (see \"Technical Reports\" in the
FullCAM Help [Table of Contents](index.htm)).

A compendium of wood densities for Australian tree species can be found
in the [NCAS Technical Report No.
18](reps/TR18%20Woody%20Density%20Phase%201%20-%20State%20of%20Knowledge.pdf){target="reps18"}.

**Other**

The report *A Carbon Accounting Model (FullCAM) for the Australian
Continent* (Richards and Evans 2001)
([www.environment.gov.au]{.underline}) might be helpful in making
configuration choices, but FullCAM has changed significantly since 2001.
