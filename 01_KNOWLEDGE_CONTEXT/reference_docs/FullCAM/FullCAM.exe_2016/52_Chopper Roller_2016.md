**Chopper Roller**

\[[Event Window](137_Event%20Window.htm) : *Chopper Roller* panel\]

Enter the inputs specific to a chopper roller event.

**Details**

A chopper roller event is where machines run over post-harvest slash
(residue) of a forest breaking up the coarse woody litter (that is,
coarse aboveground debris). This typically only occurs after thinning
100% of forest plantations, and its goal is to accelerate the breakdown
of the coarse litter.

A chopper roller event can only occur in a forest when there are no
trees.

In a chopper roller event in FullCAM:

- The specified percentages of material in the deadwood and bark pools
  are moved to the chopped wood pools.
- The distinction between decomposable and resistant material is
  maintained: there is a decomposable chopped wood pool and a resistant
  chopped wood pool.

The chopped wood pools have their own breakdown inputs, set in the
[Debris Properties](45_Debris%20Properties.htm) window for each tree
species. The breakdown percentages of the chopped wood (that is, the
percentages that breakdown per year) are typically higher than the
breakdown percentages of the deadwood or bark pools.
