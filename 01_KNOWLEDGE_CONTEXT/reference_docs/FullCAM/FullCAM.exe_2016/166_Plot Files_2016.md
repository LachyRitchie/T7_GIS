**Plot Files**

\[*Plot Files* page of the input window of an estate document\]

Specify the plot files that are used by the estate.

**Use**

An estate is a collection of plots. Each plot in the estate has a plot
file.

Details for a given plot file may be used by several plots in the
estate. For example, details of a typical pine plantation plot file
might be used for a 100 ha plot planted in 1982, a 20 ha plot planted in
1983, and so on. Therefore, the plot files are specified separately from
the plots in the estate (which saves users having to edit numerous plot
files).

All of the plot files in an estate must be in the same folder. Use the
Choose Folder button to specify the folder. Thus, you can move plot
files around on your computer as long as they remain within a single
specified folder.

Plot files are listed by name. Those coloured light blue are not used in
the estate as described, but are available for selection in the \'Plots
in the Estate\...\' tab.

To add a new plot to the list of plot files, first ensure that the
desired new plot file is located in the appropriate folder specified
using the \'Choose folder\...\' button. Then press \'New\...\' select
the desired plot from the dialog box and press \'open\...\' (or
double-click the desired plot file). To replace a plot file currently
within the plot files list select the plot file to be replaced, press
\'Edit\...\', select the files list, select the new desired plot fie,
and press \'Open\...\' (or double-click the desired plot file). This
will update all plots in the estate that used the old plot file to use
the new plot file (thereby substituting one plot file for another
throughout the entire estate). Press the \'Sort\...\' button to arrange
all plot files in the plot file list alphabetically. To delete a plot
file from the list, select the file name and press the \'Delete\...\'
button. The plot file will be removed from the estate but is not deleted
from the folder containing the various plot files.
