**Downloading Crops and Events**

\[[Data Builder](132_Data%20Builder.htm) page : *Crops and Events*
panel\]

This panel is for downloading crop species and agricultural event data,
using Data Builder.

**Basic Operation**

1.  Select a crop species from the upper list, and press the *Download
    This Species* button. This will populate the list of regimes in the
    second drop-down list.
2.  Select a regime from the regime list and press the *Download Events
    for This Regime* button. This loads the events for the selected
    regime into the events list on the [Events](136_Events.htm) page.

**Details**

When downloading a species, the Data Builder will ask if you wish to
make the species the initial species. We recommend you select "Yes",
unless you wish to apply a different species as the initial species.
Selecting "Yes" does not necessarily mean that the species exists at the
start of the simulation, only that the initial conditions for the
agricultural system (mainly the debris) will be set using that species.

The agricultural portion of the plot should now be ready to simulate (so
the *Crops* tab should not be red, and the buttons in the *Agricultural*
panel of the *Initial Conditions* page will not be red).

Agricultural regimes cycle through time for the length of the
simulation. Choosing and downloading another agricultural regime will
replace the events of the old regime with those of the new regime.

Clicking the *Clear Agricultural Events* button clears all the events
downloaded as part of the agricultural regimes.
