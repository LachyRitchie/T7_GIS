**Percentage of Precipitation Intercepted by the Tree Canopy**

\[[3PG Leaves](21_3PG%20Leaves.htm) window: *Percentage of Precipitation
Intercepted by the Tree Canopy* button\]

This [time-series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) is where you
specify the percentage of precipitation ([Rainfall](88_Rainfall.htm),
[Definite Irrigation](92_Definite%20Irrigation.htm), and [Conditional
Irrigation](91_Conditional%20Irrigation.htm)) that does not get to the
soil because it is intercepted by the tree canopy, for the current
species ([Select a Species](56_Select%20a%20Species.htm)).

**Details**

The percentage will vary by season (especially if the trees are
deciduous) and by the age of the trees.

This time-series is used by [3PG](115_3PG.htm), and also by 3PG-lite to
compute the soil water modifier --- see [Configure Tree
Production](108_Configure%20Tree%20Production.htm).

The intercept percentage is typically from 0 to 20%. Higher values
result in lower amounts of available soil water, and thus to lower
growth.
