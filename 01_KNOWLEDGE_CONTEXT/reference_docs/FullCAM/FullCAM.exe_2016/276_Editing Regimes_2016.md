**Regime Editing**

\[*Events* page : *Regime Editing*\]

This section of the Events page shows the regimes that can occur during
a simulation.

Each Regime step is composed of multiple simulation steps composed of
continuous Events (such as planting or harvesting) - see [Processes and
Events](58_Processes%20and%20Events.htm).

**Populating the Regime List**

Regimes are loaded into the list by one of four methods:

1.  Using the "[Data Builder](132_Data%20Builder.htm)"
2.  Cloning an existing item
3.  Using the "New\..." button
4.  Select multiple Events and select "Create new Regime\..." from the
    right mouse click option menu

It is possible via the "Create new Regime\..." to move Events out of
existing Regimes and create a new Regime in their place by
multi-selecting (via Shift or Ctrl key selecting) the Events to be
included.

**Editing the Regime**

Click the Edit button to open the [Edit Regime](280_Edit%20Regime.htm)
window where the name and date of the regime can be altered.
