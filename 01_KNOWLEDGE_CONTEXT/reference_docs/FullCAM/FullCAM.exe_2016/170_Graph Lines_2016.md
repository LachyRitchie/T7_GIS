**Graph Lines**

\[[Output Window](168_Output%20Window.htm) : Double-click on graph to
open the *Graph Settings* window : *Lines* page\]

Choose the properties of an output line in the graph of an *Output
Window*.

**Details**

The line width is in points, for precise control over printed output.
However the resolution of the computer screen is much less than that of
a printer, so the width of the line in screen pixels is shown in
brackets after the line width in points. (Beware: for a given number of
points, the number of pixels depends on whether or not you are using
"small fonts".)

If the line width on the screen is not equal to one pixel, then the dash
and dotted styles are drawn on the screen as solid. (This is a
limitation of *Windows*).

Note the buttons for automatically assigning colours and for making all
line widths the same as the first (in the legend) on the output window
toolbar.
