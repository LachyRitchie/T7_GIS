**Manure-From-Offsite Change**

\[[Event Window](137_Event%20Window.htm) : *Manure-From-Offsite Change*
panel\]

Enter the inputs specific to a manure-from-offsite change event.

**Details**

Enter the yearly level of application of manure from offsite to the
forest or agricultural soil, from now until the next manure-from-offsite
event (of the same kind, forest or agricultural).

There is no application of manure from offsite at the beginning of a
simulation. Application of manure to the soil begins with the first
manure-from-offsite event. Turn off future application of manure from
offsite again by setting the input of a manure-from-offsite event to
zero.

Manure from offsite is in addition to and separate from the manure due
to grazing animals in an agricultural system.

This event is only used when the *Nitrogen Fertiliser Application*
setting on the [Configure Event Or
time-series](195_Configure%20Event%20Or%20time-series.htm) window is set
to *Events*.

Set the properties of the manure in [Soil
Inputs](193_Soil%20Inputs.htm).
