**Manure Inputs to Soil from Offsite**

\[[Soil Inputs](193_Soil%20Inputs.htm) window : *Manure from Offsite*
button\]

This [time-series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) is where you
specify the carbon mass (and maybe also the nitrogen mass) entering the
soil from outside the plot, in tonnes per hectare.

**Details**

Manure from offsite (that is, from outside the plot) may be added to the
forest or agricultural soil.

In an agricultural system, manure from animals on the plot is dealt with
by grazing --- see the [Grazing Change](196_Grazing%20Change.htm)
events: plant material eaten by grazing animals becomes fodder, which
may go to destinations including the DPM an RPM pools of the soil. This
manure-from-offsite time-series is the only explicit treatment of manure
by FullCAM.

This time-series is only used when the *Manure-From-Offsite Added to the
Soil* setting on the [Configure Event Or
time-series](195_Configure%20Event%20Or%20time-series.htm) window is set
to *time-series*.
