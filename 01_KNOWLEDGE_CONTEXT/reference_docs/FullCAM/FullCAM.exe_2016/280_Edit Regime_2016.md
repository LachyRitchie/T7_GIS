**Edit Regime Window**

\[*Events* page : Regime *Edit* button\]

This window is for editing an individual Regime.

**Name**

Every Regime needs a (non-blank) name, and the name must be unique
within the regime list.

**Timing**

Specify the regime time, as either:

1.  . Calendar date\
    Examples: 1 Jan 2001, 31 Dec 2010.

    Enter the date in any unambiguous way, such as "4 Sep 2010", "s4",
    "au9 1999", "4s2000", "8/4/0" or "8.4.1999", except that you cannot
    use hyphens because they are interpreted as negative signs (for
    example 8 4 -35 is 8 Apr -35).

2.  Calendar years and days since the start of the simulation\
    Example: -10, 0, 2345.

    A calendar year is from a date in one year to the same date in the
    next year, and can contain either 365 or 366 days depending on leap
    years. The number of days can also be huge. So if you mean the same
    date in two years time, set the calendar years equal to two and the
    days to zero, but if you mean exactly 730 days then set the calendar
    years to zero and the days to 730.

Go back and forth between the date types to see how they compare -
changes in one are reflected in the other, that is, they both show the
same date.

A regime always occurs at noon of the day on which it is specified to
occur, even if that time is in the middle of a simulation step. FullCAM
computes the continuous processes for the partial step up to the regime,
executes the regime, then computes the continuous processes up to the
next regime or the end of the step.

Each regime occurs instantaneously - it begins and ends at noon of the
same day.

**Add Days**

A offset may be applied to an event by entering a value in the *Days*
field and clicking *Add Days* button. This can be either positive or
negative and will move the event that number of days forward or back in
the event queue.
