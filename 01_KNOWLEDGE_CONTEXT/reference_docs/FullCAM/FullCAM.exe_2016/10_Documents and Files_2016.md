**Documents and Files**

This topic is about using documents and files in FullCAM.

**Definitions**

A *document* in FullCAM is a set of information about a plot or estate
simulation and is represented as an input window and other optional
windows (output windows, diagrams window, and so on). A document exists
only in computer memory --- fast electronic memory that **is erased**
when you exit FullCAM or turn off your computer.

A *file* is a set of information stored as a single entity on a
computer's hard disk. A file **is not erased** when you exit FullCAM or
turn off your computer --- the file will still be there when you turn
the computer back on.

**Document Types**

FullCAM Standard Edition has two document types:

*Plot document*\
Represents a "plot", an area of land with uniform characteristics.
Masses are in tonnes per hectare if there is no area, or in tonnes if
you input an area. Saved in a "plot file", whose file extension is
".plo". See [Plot Simulation](177_Plot%20Simulation.htm).

*Estate document*\
Represents an "estate", which is arbitrary collection of plots each with
its own area. Masses are in tonnes. Saved in an "estate file", whose
file extension is ".est". See [Estate
Simulation](72_Estate%20Simulation.htm).

You will probably mainly use plot documents --- for modelling forests,
crops, carbon emissions and so on, on a single homogeneous area. Estates
add areas to plots, allowing you to combine separate plots to model an
heterogeneous area --- such as for modelling a series of plantation
forest stands.

Typically, spatial and database documents are used only by Department of
the Environment to compute Australia's national carbon account. However,
if you have the appropriate data you can simulate any landscape.

**Opening Multiple Documents**

FullCAM can open any number of documents at once. A list of all open
FullCAM documents can be viewed in the drop down list on the main
window.

The *Windows* menu on the [Main Window](217_Main%20Window.htm) allows
you to manage the windows individually, on a window by window basis.

You must use one of the Save commands from the File menu to save a
document as a file before exiting FullCAM. It is also wise to save your
document periodically while you are working, to guard against unexpected
program termination such as might be caused by a power failure.
