**Events**

\[*Events* page of the input window of a plot document\]

This page shows the regimes and events that can occur during a
simulation.

Each simulation step consists of continuous processes (such as growth or
decomposition) punctuated by any events that occur during that step ---
see [Processes and Events](58_Processes%20and%20Events.htm).

**Regime and Event Queue**

The events are presented on the page in a list, one event per line.

To view or edit an individual event, open it in the [Event
Window](137_Event%20Window.htm) by double-clicking on it or selecting it
then pressing the *Edit* button. Click the list section headers to sort
the queue --- sort by *Year* to sort them by time, that is, to show the
events in chronological sequence.

The sequence of events that occur during the simulation is called the
*event queue*. If the list of events is sorted by time, then the
simulating events on the list, in the order presented, constitute the
event queue. In most circumstances the terms "event list" and "event
queue" are used interchangeably.

  Event Name     Description
  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Forest         Only affects the forest system, such as plant trees, forest fire
  Agricultural   Only affects the agricultural system, such as plant crops, harvest
  Mixed          Affects both the forest and agricultural systems, such as forest fraction change

**Populating the Event List**

Events are loaded into the Event List by one of three methods:

Using the "[Data Builder"](132_Data%20Builder.htm)

Cloning an existing item

Using the "New\..." button

**Editing Event Timing**

The timing of events can be edited using the [event order
editing](274_Editing%20Event%20List%20Order.htm) functions.

**Simulating Events**

An event is *simulating* if it will occur in a simulation. All events
are simulating, except:

- Events that occur outside the period of the simulation (too early or
  too late)
- Events that have been switched off (see [Event
  Timing](143_Event%20Timing.htm)). Events can be switched off on the
  [Event Window](137_Event%20Window.htm), or on the Events page by the
  secondary mouse button and selecting either *Simulate Events* or *Do
  Not Simulate Events*.

Non-simulating events have no effect on the simulation.

**Initial Conditions**

The initial conditions panel lists the [Initial
Trees](185_Initial%20Trees.htm) and [Initial
Crops](184_Initial%20Crops.htm) species names that are growing in the
system at the start of the simulation.

The [Initial Trees](185_Initial%20Trees.htm) is always displayed first.
If there are no initial tree or crop species growing at the start of the
simulation then `No trees` or `No crops` are displayed accordingly.

Due to screen width restrictions the species name(s) may be truncated.

**Event Colour-Coding**

The timing fields on the event list (*Year*, *Day*, *Step in Year*) are
colour-coded to indicate the method used to specify the time of the
event:

  colour       Method
  ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------
  White        Calendar time (such as 1995 day 24)
  Light blue   Time since start of simulation (such as 3 years 24 days)

The names on the event list are colour coded to indicate whether they
are ready, whether they are simulating or not, and what system they
affect:

  colour   Status / System
  -------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Red      Event not ready (renders event queue not ready)
  Grey     Event non-simulating (outside simulation period, will not affect simulation)
  Green    Forest
  Yellow   Agricultural
  Brown    Mixed

Finally, the events you select with the mouse are coloured in the usual
highlight colour.

**Event Queue and Readiness**

If the event queue is not ready then the "Events" title on the tab of
the *Events* page is shown in red. Some event queues are not ready
because they do not make sense --- such as a tree planting when there
are already trees, or a tree thin when there are no trees. The first
event that causes the event queue to be unready is highlighted in red,
and the "Status" box describes the state of the event queue to help you
sort out any problems. You are responsible for entering a sequence of
events that is valid (that is, such that FullCAM considers that the
event queue is ready).

**Clearing Events**

A *clearing* event is one that clears a system (forest or agricultural)
of all plants. Depending on their extent, thins, harvests and fires
might be clearing. Ploughs and herbicides are always clearing. Once a
system is cleared, it needs to be planted before there is any more plant
growth.
