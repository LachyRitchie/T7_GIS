**Soil Inputs**

\[[Soil](203_Soil.htm) page : *Forest* or *Agricultural* panel :
*Inputs* button\]

Specify the material that enters the soil. See the
[RothC](114_RothC.htm) soil pool abbreviations.

**Soil Input Percentages of Broken-Down Litter**

Specify where the broken-down litter goes to within the active soil.

The material in each litter pool breaks down, thereby transporting
material from the litter to the soil. This material, the broken-down
litter, can enter the DPM, RPM or HUM pools within the soil. Here, you
specify, for each type of broken down litter, which of these soil pools
the broken-down litter enters.

The decomposable (resistant) broken-down litter always goes to either
the DPM (RPM) or the HUM.

Naturally, the sum of each pair of percentages is 100%. Therefore the
HUM percentage is calculated automatically from the DPM/RPM value.

TABLE -- Typical values used are:

  Variable              To DPM or RPM   To HUM
  --------------------- --------------- --------
  Decomposable Litter   90              10
  Resistant Litter      90              10

**Manure from Offsite**

Manure from offsite (from outside the plot) may be added to the forest
or agricultural soil. Offsite manure inputs are only available if RothC
is used to model the soil.

Enter the time-series of manure carbon additions or add manure
application events to the \'Events\' tab depending on how manure
additions were configured in the \'Events\' or time-series window of the
\'Configuration Tab\'

Manure from offsite may be added to the forest or agricultural soil.
Enter the carbon mass in the manure, in tonnes per hectare, over time.

\'Offsite\' means \'from outside the plot\'. Offsite manure inputs are
only available if Roth C is used to model the soil.

In an agricultural system, manure from animals on the plot is dealt with
by grazing events (plant material eaten by grazing animals becomes
fodder, which may move to destinations including the DPM an RPM pools of
the soil). The offsite manure is the only explicit treatment of manure
by FullCAM.

Specify the percentages of the carbon in any offsite manure added to the
soil that move to the various organic soil components. That is, specify
the percentages of the carbon in the manure that are in the form of the
various soil components, when added to the soil. The percentages add to
100%; the HUM percentage is automatically calculated from the others.

Note that manure from offsite and grazing are entirely separate. The
manure inputs entered here have no effect on any grazing manure, and
vice versa.

TABLE --- Typical values used are:

Percentage of Manure

  Variable   Carbon that goes to
  ---------- ---------------------
  DPM        49
  RPM        49
  BIO-F      0
  BIO-S      0

**Plant Residues**

Plant residue inputs are plant material from the debris that enters the
soil. The material enters the DPM soil pool if it is decomposable, or
the RPM soil pool if it is resistant. Specify the total amount of plant
material entering the soil over time.

Plant residues can only be specified here if you are simulating the
[Soil](203_Soil.htm) by itself. If you are simulating a multi-layer
system, then the plant residues from the debris are automatically
calculated, so an explicit input for plant residues is neither required
nor desired.

The ratio of DPM to RPM is the mass of DPM divided by the mass of RPM in
the plant matter added to the soil, and is also known as the "quality
factor for incoming plant debris". Typical values for the ratio of DPM
to RPM are:

1.44 - Most agricultural crops and improved grassland\
0.67 - Unimproved grassland and scrub (including savanna)\
0.25 - Deciduous and tropical woodland.
