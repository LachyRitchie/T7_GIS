**Constituent Models In FullCAM**

This topic is about the constituent models ("sub-models") within
FullCAM.

**Introduction**

FullCAM integrates these models into a single cohesive model. FullCAM
has since been expanded with capabilities that go well beyond just the
constituent models.

**FullCAM Consists of Three Constituent Models**

FullCAM is a flexible and highly integrated system of three existing
models, each of which deals with particular aspects of the carbon and
nitrogen cycling and greenhouse emissions accounting. The models can be
used in various configurations, depending on your requirements.

1.  [CAMFor](77_CAMFor.htm) --- **C**arbon **A**ccounting **M**odel for
    **For**estry Models carbon cycling in a forest, including the trees,
    debris and soil. Forest growth can be included as yield curves,
    empirical growth formula, or process modelling.
2.  [CAMAg](78_CAMAg.htm) --- **C**arbon **A**ccounting **M**odel for
    **Ag**riculture Models carbon cycling in an agricultural system,
    including the crops, debris, soil, minerals, and agricultural
    products. Includes both cropping and grazing.
3.  [RothC](114_RothC.htm) --- **Roth**amsted Institute active soil
    **C**arbon model Models carbon cycling in the active soil.

**Seamless Integration Into a Single Model**

FullCAM always uses the constituent models appropriately, combining them
as required into what appears as a single model of your specified plot.

CAMFor and CAMAg are framework models --- they model multiple layers of
a forest or an agricultural system respectively, and provide frameworks
into which the other models can be embedded. RothC is a specialist model
--- it only simulates a single layer of a forest or agricultural system,
but does so in more detail than CAMFor or CAMAg.

When you configure FullCAM, the constituent models are switched on and
off as required by the configuration. The FullCAM
[Configuration](150_Configuration.htm) page only allows you to enter
configurations that makes physical sense.

**Types of Plot That Can Be Modelled**

FullCAM allows you to run all sensible combinations of these models, to
model any of the following:

1.  A forest
2.  An agricultural system
3.  A mixed forest and agricultural system
4.  Soil only (either forest or agricultural).

FullCAM can model one forest and one agricultural system simultaneously.
Forests and agricultural systems both have debris and both have soil, so
RothC has both forest and agricultural versions. There are thus four
distinct model-instances:

1.  CAMFor
2.  CAMAg
3.  Forest RothC
4.  Agricultural RothC

Forest RothC and agricultural RothC are identical except that the soil
is always covered in forest RothC but may be either bare or covered in
agricultural RothC.
