**Select Outputs**

\[[Output Window](168_Output%20Window.htm) : *Select Which Outputs to
Show* toolbar button\]\
\[[Sensitivity Analysis](160_Sensitivity%20Analysis.htm) window :
*FullCAM Outputs* button\]

Specify a set of FullCAM outputs, for display by the accompanying output
window or for use in a risk analysis.

**Use**

There are about 800 possible outputs, but this window shows only those
outputs that are available in the configuration of the current document.
Hover the mouse over the name of an output and you see a description of
the output that has been tailored to your configuration. Sometimes the
description is merely the same as the name.

Single-click on the icon or name of an output to select or deselect it.
Selected outputs are marked with a red tick.

The outputs are organised into folders, just like files are organised
into folders in Windows Explorer. Click on the plus (+) and minus (--)
buttons to expand and collapse the folders. A single-click on the icon
or name of a folder selects or deselects everything within the folder.

The number of outputs is shown in a message at the bottom of the window.
Hover the mouse over the message with the number of outputs to find out
how many outputs are chosen but that are unavailable in this
configuration (they were chosen previously, while the plot was in a
different configuration).

Choosing flows and leaks as outputs slows down the simulation a little.
This slowness is only likely to be significant in spatial simulations or
simulations of large estates.
