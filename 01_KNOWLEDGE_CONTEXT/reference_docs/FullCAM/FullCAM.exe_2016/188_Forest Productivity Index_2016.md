**Forest Productivity Index**

\[[Site : Productivity](64_Site_Productivity.htm) window : *Forest
Productivity Index* button\]\
This [time-series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) is where enter
the forest productivity index (FPI) for the plot.

**Forest Productivity Index**

This window provides options for computing the forest productivity
index, which is required if the tree yield formula is used to compute
tree growth. It is a simplified variant of the 3PG model and produces an
index (equivalent to a site class) as either a long-term average (as
will life affect the life of a forest/plantation rotation) or as a
time-series (monthly or annual dataset) to consider the variability in
the site class over time.

As an alternative to calculating the forest productivity index, a value
can be obtained for the specified latitude and longitude in the [Data
Builder](132_Data%20Builder.htm).

**Details**

The forest productivity index is used if the tree production method is
the [Tree Yield Formula](130_Tree%20Yield%20Formula.htm) and the forest
productivity index is not calculated from scratch (see [Configure Tree
Production](108_Configure%20Tree%20Production.htm)).

The forest productivity index is a dimensionless measure of site
productivity due to soil, sunlight, rainfall, evaporation, and frost.
The forest productivity index varies during the year. Higher values of
forest productivity index result in more NPP produced by the trees.

The forest productivity index is described by the Australian Greenhouse
Office in [Report 27 of the National Carbon Accounting
Reports](reps/TR27%20Biomass%20Estimation%20Approaches%20for%20Assessment%20of%20Stocks%20and%20Stock%20Change.pdf){target="reps23"}
series.

The forest productivity index is an annualised rate, and is entered as a
single value that it would be if it continued at that rate for a whole
year.

Forest productivity index values can range from 0 to 100.

If actual site data is available, enter it in this time-series. If not,
use [Data Builder](132_Data%20Builder.htm) to download estimated monthly
forest productivity index (annualised). The derivation of this data is
described in [NCAS Technical Report
No.23](reps/TR23%20Developing%20a%20National%20Forest%20Productivity%20Model.pdf){target="reps23"}.
