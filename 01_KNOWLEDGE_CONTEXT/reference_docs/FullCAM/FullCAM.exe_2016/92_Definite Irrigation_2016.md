**Definite Irrigation**

\[[Site : Water](12_Site_Water.htm) window : *Definite Irrigation*
button (*Forest* or *Agricultural*)\]

This [time-series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) is where you
enter irrigation that definitely occurs (does not depend on conditions),
in millimetres (100 mm = 1 megalitre per hectare).

The window is also a typical time-series window provided that irrigation
was specified to occur as a time-series in the \'Events or time-series\'
window of the \'Configuration

Tab\'. If irrigation was specified as events, then irrigation events
need to be added to the \'Events\' Tab.

**Details**

This time-series is only used when the *Irrigation* setting on the
[Configure Event Or
time-series](195_Configure%20Event%20Or%20time-series.htm) window is set
to *time-series*.

See [Site : Water](12_Site_Water.htm).
