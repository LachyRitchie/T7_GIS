[Growth Properties window (for trees) :
Any of the *Increments* buttons]

This [time-series Window] is one of the
tree increment time-series windows, where you specify the growth of the
trees as either:

- Volume increments of stems [m^3^/ha]
- Mass increments of various tree components [tdm/ha]
- NPP flows to various tree components [tdm/ha].

**Details**

Stems have no turnover, so NPP flows to the stems are equal to the yield
increments of the stems.

Stem volume increments are converted to stem mass increments by
multiplying by the [Stem Density].
