Describe the soil in the plot at the start of the simulation.

See the RothC soil pool abbreviations.

**Carbon Masses**

Enter the mass of carbon in the various soil pools, in tonnes per
hectare as a time-series.

**Water**

The topsoil moisture deficit (TSMD) is the amount of rainfall, in mm,
required to saturate the topsoil with water. It is a moisture *deficit*,
so the number you enter is zero or positive. The TSMD is used by RothC
to simulate soil decomposition.
