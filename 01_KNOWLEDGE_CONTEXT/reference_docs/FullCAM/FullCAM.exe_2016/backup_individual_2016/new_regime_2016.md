[Events page : *New Regime* Panel]

**Use**

The "New Regime" panel enables addition of new events to the "Events
List".

**Select Species**

A species is selected from the "Species" drop-down list. As a visual
guide, species that have been used previously during the session are
displayed in bold.

**Select Regime**

Once a species has been selected, any of the regimes for that species
may be selected from the "Regime" selection drop-down list.

**Select Occurrences**

The "occurrences" edit box can be edited directly or can be set using
the up-down selector attached to it.

**OK Button**

Once the "OK" button has been pressed, the events of the selected regime
are added to the end of the event queue. The added regime is repeated at
the end of the event queue the number of times specified by the
"occurrences" setting.

**Regime Name**

Every Regime needs a (non-blank) name, and the name must be unique
within the regime list. A default name will be shown in the *Name*
field, but may be changed.
