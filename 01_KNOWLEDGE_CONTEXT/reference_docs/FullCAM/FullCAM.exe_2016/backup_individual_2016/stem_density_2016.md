---title: Stem Densityversion: 2016category: Plant Propertiesoriginal_file: 9_Stem Density_2016.md---[Plant Properties window : *Stem Density*button]This time-series Window is where enter the stem density (also known as the "basic density") of a tree species.**Details**FullCAM uses masses for all its calculations, so stem density is only used to convert between stem masses and stem volumes. You require stem density if:- Modelling a multilayer forest and any of the following:  - Tree growth is specified by stem volume increments  - The amount of stem material is specified by volume in the initial    conditions  - The amount of stem material in any tree planting is specified by    volume.If stem density is not required for any of the above then it is not used(that is, it will not affect FullCAM calculations), even though you arefree to enter it into the document.See the *Properties of the Species time-series* section of GrowthProperties.If only the trees are modelled, the plant age used in the stem densitytime-series is the maximum age of the plants (there are no events inthis configuration, so the maximum and average ages are the same).Because the stem density is a time-series, it may vary with the age ofthe tree (set *Years are* to "Years since plants sprouted") or withthe year (set *Years are* to "Calendar years" or "Years since startof simulation").The stem density is of the whole stem at the time indicated, not of thenew stem growth in that year. The units are kilograms per cubic metre(note: most other masses in FullCAM are in tonnes).The density of stem wood is typically about 300 -- 1,000 kgdm/m^3^. Acompendium of wood densities for Australian tree species can be found in the NCAS Technical Report No.18.If you have only a single number for stem density, just use that. (Set*Years of data* to 1, *Data points per year* to 1, resize thetime-series, and enter the stem density in the single cell of thetime-series. *Years are* and *Extrapolation* can be set to anything.)Typical values for native forest communities are described in Table 7 of*Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Land Use Change in Australia: AnIntegrated Application of the National Carbon Accounting System*.
