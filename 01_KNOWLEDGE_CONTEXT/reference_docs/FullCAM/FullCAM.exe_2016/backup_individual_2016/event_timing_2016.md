---title: Event Timingversion: 2016category: Eventoriginal_file: 143_Event Timing_2016.md---[Event Window (via theEvents page): *Timing* panel]Enter timing information for the event.**"Simulate" Checkbox**The *Simulate* checkbox specifies whether or not the event is to besimulated. Uncheck this box to effectively turn the event off --- itwill still be on the event queue, but it will not be simulated (it willhave no effect on a simulation). This is useful for temporarilysuspending an event from the simulation.The *Simulate* checkbox may be checked or unchecked on the EventWindow, or on the Events pageby the secondary mouse button and selecting either *Simulate Events* or*Do Not Simulate Events*.**Type and Time**Specify the event time, as either a:1. Calendar dateExamples: 1 Jan 2001, 31 Dec 2010.Enter the date in any unambiguous way, such as "4 Sep 2010", "s4","au9 1999", "4s2000", "8/4/0" or "8.4.1999", except that youcannot use hyphens because they are interpreted as negative signs (forexample 8 4 -35 is 8 Apr -35).2. Calandar years and days since the start of the simulationExample: -10, 0, 2345.A calendar year is from a date in one year to the same date in the nextyear, and can contain either 365 or 366 days depending on leap years.The number of days can also be huge. So if you mean the same date in twoyears time, set the calendar years equal to two and the days to zero,but if you mean exactly 730 days then set the calendar years to zero andthe days to 730.Go back and forth between the date types to see how they compare -changes in one are reflected in the other, that is, they both show thesame date.An event always occurs at noon of the day on which it is specified tooccur, even if that time is in the middle of a simulation step. FullCAMcomputes the continuous processes for the partial step up to the event,executes the event, then computes the continuous processes up to thenext event or the end of the step.Each event occurs instantaneously --- it begins and ends at noon of thesame day.Event timing may be updated for multiple events by multi-selecting theevents on the Event List, and then selecting the right mouse option*Apply Offset to Events*. The timing may then be updated by the EventUpdate dialog.**Add Days**A offset may be applied to an event by entering a value in the *Days*field and clicking *Add Days* button. This can be either positive ornegative and will move the event that number of days forward or back inthe event queue.
