[Site page : *Productivity* button]

Enter information about the productivity of the plot.

**Use**

"Soil fertility rating" and "Soil nutrition modifier" (which are very
closely related) are on this window in the Site page
rather than on the Soil page because they represent
general properties of the site and its soil, rather than properties due
entirely to soil characteristics.

The forest productivity index (FPI) is required when the tree yield
formula is used to compute tree production, and the FPI is not computed
from scratch by FullCAM --- see Configure Tree
Production.

Only one of these three measures of productivity is required at any one
time.
