Events).

- Select an initial rotation *Tree-species/Regimes.* The initial list
  displayed will be initial rotation plantation *Tree-species/Regimes*
  only.
- Select a subsequent rotation *Tree-species/Regimes.* Subsequent lists

be added either within the same *Tree-species groups* or from other
groups to model transitions from one plantation species to another.
