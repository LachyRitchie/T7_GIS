[Species or Regime Selection : *Text match
filter* panel]

Input text to filter the tree or crop species, or alternatively the
forest or agricultural regime list displayed.

**Details**

A text filter maybe used to filter a regime or species list. The text
filter to be applied is a single block of text, and can be a whole or
part word(s).

The text match filter is applied in conjunction with either the Species
or Regime Selection : Tree or Crop Species
Filter,
or the Species or Regime Selection : Forest or Agricultural Regime
Filter
(depending on the search window invoked).

If the text filter field is blank then no text filter is applied to the
list.

The text filter is *not* case sensitive.
