[Event Window : *Thin* panel]

A thin event is where some or all of the forest is harvested.

**Introduction**

The agricultural counterpart of a thin is a Harvest
event

A thin is the only event that creates forest products, that is, takes
tree material offsite. See the Product
Properties of each species.

**Affected Portion**

The *affected portion* is the fraction of the total forest area being
modelled in which the thin takes place. It is also the fraction of the
plot area that is thinned --- the proportion of an unspecified areas to
be reported on a per hectare basis. For most plantations this would
generally equate to the fraction of the proportion of trees that are
thinned.

**Clearing Thin**

For a thin to be clearing (that is, to clear the forest of trees), the
affected portion must be 100% and the destination percentages for each
pool must add to 100%.
