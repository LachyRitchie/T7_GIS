Details

Native forest to plantation forest management systems are created in
FullCAM by using a plot type of *Multi-layer forest system*.

Other systems that may be created by FullCAM are:

Pasture to Plantation
Forest
Plantation Forest to Plantation
Forest
Native Forest to Pasture
Grazed Woodland
Crop and Pasture Management

**Method**

*Configuration*

- Plot Type : Multi-layer forest system.

*Databuilder*

Select the required *Trees and Events* (refer Downloading Trees and
Events).

- Select Tree species group *Local species*.
- Select an initial rotation *Tree-species/Regimes.* The initial list
  displayed will be *Local species* only.
- Select a subsequent rotation *Tree-species/Regimes.* This will require
  you to select another Tree species group value. Subsequent lists
  displayed will be plantation *Tree-species/Regimes* only.

Subsequent rotation *Tree-species/Regimes* may be selected and
downloaded as often as required. Additional *Tree-species/Regimes* can
be added either within the same *Tree-species groups* or from other
groups to model transitions from one plantation species to another.
