By specifying the average age of theplants that are removed from the plot, and whether or not new plantsspring up to replace them, you can control the change in the average ageof the plants.This is only of interest if you are using the average age of the plantsto determine relative allocations or growth (see the [GrowthProperties](growth_properties.md) windows), in which case you cancontrol how the event moves the plants along their growth curves.These settings are only relevant (and thus enabled) for thinnings thatleave some stems or stalks (that is, the fraction of plants removed isless than 100%).**Default Setting**Most people will want the default setting:1.0 in the top box0.0 in the middle0.0 in the bottom box,Do not check the *Replace removed plants...* box.Under this setting:- The average age of the removed plants is equal to the average age of  the existing plants- The average age of the plants on the plot is not changed by the event- No new plants grow to replace the removed plants.**Removal-Age Formula**Specify the average age (in years) of the plants that are removed by theevent by specifying the three coefficients in a formula:1.  The multiplier for the current average age of the plants (*A*)2.  The multiplier for the age of the oldest plants in the forest or    crop (*B*)3.  An additive constant, in years. (*C*)The average age of the removed plants is> *A* * (average age of plants) + *B* * (age of oldest plants) + *C*.If this average age is less than zero it is changed to zero; if it isgreater than the age of the oldest plants it is changed to the age of theoldest plants.**Example 1**. If *A* = 0, *B* = 0, *C* = 15 then the average age of theremoved plants is 15 years. So if the average age of the plants at thetime of the event was 10 years, then the average age of the removedplants would be 15 years. So if 50% of the stems or stalks were removedand there was no replacement, then the average age of the plants afterthe event would be 5 years.**Example 2**. If *A* = 1.2, *B* = 0, *C* = --0.5 then the average ageof the removed plants is 20% greater than the average age of plants(before the event) less half a year. So if the average age of the plantsat the time of the event was 10 years, then the average age of theremoved plants would be 1.2 * 10 -- 0.5 = 11.5 years. So if 50% of thestems or stalks were removed without replacement then the average age ofthe plants after the event would be 8.5 years.The average age of the removed plants is only used to calculate theaverage age of the remaining plants. It is your responsibility tospecify the average age of the removed plants sensibly. If the averageage of the plants after the event is greater than the age of the oldestplants then it is changed to the age of the oldest plants.The age of the oldest plants is not affected by the event --- it is onlyaltered by planting or clearing events, and the passage of time.**Replacement**Check the *Replace removed plants with new plants (of age 0)* box if youwant new plants to grow spontaneously, starting from age zero at thetime of the event and without a planting event, in the spaces leftbehind by the removed plants.Checking this box is appropriate for a native forest, but usually notappropriate for a plantation forest. If the thinned trees wereintermingled through the forest, the non-thinned trees may bulk up tofill the space previously occupied by the thinned trees (so consider aforest treatment event that lowers the effective age of the trees). Ifthe thinned trees all come from the same portion of the plot and thatportion is completely cleared by the thin, then it would be better tomodel the forest with an [EstateSimulation](estate_simulation.md), using multiple plot files toreflect the different management, rather than as a single plot file.**Coppices**If there are no stems or stalks left after the event yet the event isnot a clearing event (so the affected portion is 100% but the sum of thedestination percentages for at least one pool is less than 100%), thenthe average age of the plants is not changed by the event (thus, you cancreate coppices).
