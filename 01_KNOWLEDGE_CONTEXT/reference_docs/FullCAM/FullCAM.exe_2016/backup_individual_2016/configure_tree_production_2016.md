Specify how the production of new tree material should be calculated.

**Introduction**

The amount of new tree material is called the *net primary production*
(NPP) of the trees, and is the combined outcome of photosynthesis and
respiration.

**Method**

Choose a tree growth method:

- *Increments* - FullCAM will use time-series of volume or mass
  increments of new growth, by calendar year or by tree age. You have to
  supply that data, in the Growth
  Properties window.
- *Tree yield formula* Uses an equation, the Tree Yield
  Formula, to calculate tree growth.
