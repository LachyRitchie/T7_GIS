[*Data Builder* page of the input window of a plot document]

Use the Data Builder to download data from the Departmental
Server into your plot document. For help
on the three panels on this page, see:

- Downloading Trees and
  Events

  Events

**Introduction**

The Data Builder allows you to easily build ready-to-run plots by
downloading the input data for your plot from the Departmental
Server.

Although the Data Builder has been designed for ease of use, it is
"open" enough for experienced users to build complex systems. Take care
when downloading complex data or modifying downloaded data, or modelling
errors can result.

**Internet Connection to the FullCAM Server**

Using the Data Builder requires that your computer be connected to the
Internet. The Data Builder will automatically connect as required.

Check the *Data Builder on* box to acknowledge that you are connected to
the Internet and thus ready to proceed.

**Plot Configuration**

The Data Builder is only available for the multi-layer plot types (see
Configure the Plot), namely multi-layer
forest systems, multi-layer agricultural systems, and mixed multi-layer
systems. Your choice of plot type will affect the species and regime
data offered for downloading. For example, Regimes
including a transition from pasture to plantation are not available for
a multi-layer forest system because a pasture is modelled by an
agricultural system.

**Download Tree and Crop Species Required by the Event Queue**

Downloading tree and crop regimes puts events on the
Events page but does not download the species
mentioned by those events. This button (the "Download Events for This
Regime" button) is only enabled if there are species required by the
event queue that have not been downloaded yet, and it downloads all of
those species at once. Pressing this button is often more convenient
than downloading the required species individually.
