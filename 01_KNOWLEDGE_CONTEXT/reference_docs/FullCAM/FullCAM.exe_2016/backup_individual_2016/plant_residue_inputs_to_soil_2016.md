[Soil Inputs window : *Plant Residues*
button]

This time-series Window is where you
specify the carbon mass of plant residues from the debris and mulch that
enter the soil, in tonnes per hectare.

**Details**

FullCAM automatically calculates these inputs in multi-layer plot models
that include the soil (Configure the
Plot), so this input is only required
when the soil is being modelled on its own.
