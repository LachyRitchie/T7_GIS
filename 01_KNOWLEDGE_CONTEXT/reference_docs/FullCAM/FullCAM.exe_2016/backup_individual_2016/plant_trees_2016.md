[Event Window : *Plant Trees* panel]

Enter the inputs specific to a tree-planting event.

**Age**

Enter here the age of the trees when planted, in years. For example, if
planting six months old seedlings, enter "0.5" years, or, if planting
seeds, enter "0.0" years.

**Volume**

The volume of the stems of the trees when planted, in cubic metres per
hectare.

This volume will be converted to a mass in the FullCAM simulation by
multiplying it by the stem density.

**Mass**

If the 'masses' option was selected from the 'Specify Tree Size By'
list, enter the mass of all tree components when the trees were planted.
If the 'Volume for stems, masses for other components' option was
selected, enter the mass of the non-stem tree components when planted,
in tonnes per hectare and the volume of stems of the trees at planting.
This volume will be converted to a mass in the FullCAM simulation by
multiplying it by the stem density.

**Species**

Select the species of tree to be planted from the drop down list of
available species.

If the species required is not available a new species must be entered
using the Select a Species
list on the Trees Tab.

**Specify Tree Size**

Select the method of specifying tree size by selecting one of the
options in the drop down list.
