[*Simulate* menu, on the Main Window]

This topic is about the items on the *Simulate* menu.

**Run Simulation**

Select 'Run Plot Simulation' to run a simulation on the current
document. The type of simulation depends on the current document type:

  Document Type   Simulation Type
  --------------- -------------------
  Plot            plot simulation
  Estate          estate simulation

If multiple plots and /or estates are open when 'Run Plot Simulation'
is selected only the active (front most) plot estate is simulated.
