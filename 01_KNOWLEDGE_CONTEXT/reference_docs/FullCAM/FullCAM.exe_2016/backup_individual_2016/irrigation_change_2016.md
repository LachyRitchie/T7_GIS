[Event Window : *Irrigation Change* panel]

Enter the inputs specific to an irrigation change event.

**Details**

Enter the inputs that describe the level of forest or agricultural
irrigation from now until the next irrigation event (of the same kind,
forest or agricultural).

There is no irrigation at the beginning of a simulation. Irrigation
begins with the first irrigation event. Turn off future irrigation again
by setting all the inputs of an irrigation event to zero.

This time-series is only used when the *Irrigation* setting on the
Configure Event Or
time-series window is set
to *Events*.
