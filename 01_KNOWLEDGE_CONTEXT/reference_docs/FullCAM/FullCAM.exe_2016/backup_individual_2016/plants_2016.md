They are each partitioned into three panels:- Select a Species panel- Properties of the Species  panel**About Species**Clearing events, such as a Thin,Havest, Forest Fire, orAgricultural Fire, can remove the plantsif there are plants growing.If there are no plants growing (that is, the system is clear), thenplanting events, namely Plant Trees or PlantCrop, can set plants growing on the plot. Aplanting event can plant any species listed on this panel.By clearing one species then planting a different species, a plot canhave several different species growing during the plot simulation - butonly one species growing in a system at any one time.The debris and products of each species are tracked separately, becausethey have characteristics that may differ from species to species.However, all species are treated the same with respect to the mulch andsoil - different species merely have different proportions ofdecomposable or resistant material, and different proportions of"more-resistant" material in the resistant material.
