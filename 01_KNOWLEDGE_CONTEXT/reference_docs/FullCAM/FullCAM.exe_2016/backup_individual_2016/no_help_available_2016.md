pages have no help. When you are there, pressing "F1" leads you to here.

Otherwise, you may be here by error. If there was a help button (yellow
question mark on small green circle) on the window or page you had
selected, then you should have been lead to the help for that button ---
please Contact Us so we know to fix the error.

Press the appropriate help button with the mouse if there are any
