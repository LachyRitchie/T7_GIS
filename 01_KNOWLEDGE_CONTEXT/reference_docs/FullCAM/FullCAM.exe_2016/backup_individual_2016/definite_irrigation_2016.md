[Site : Water window : *Definite Irrigation*
button (*Forest* or *Agricultural*)]

This time-series Window is where you
enter irrigation that definitely occurs (does not depend on conditions),
in millimetres (100 mm = 1 megalitre per hectare).

The window is also a typical time-series window provided that irrigation
was specified to occur as a time-series in the 'Events or time-series'
window of the 'Configuration

Tab'. If irrigation was specified as events, then irrigation events
need to be added to the 'Events' Tab.

**Details**

This time-series is only used when the *Irrigation* setting on the
Configure Event Or
time-series window is set
to *time-series*.

See Site : Water.
