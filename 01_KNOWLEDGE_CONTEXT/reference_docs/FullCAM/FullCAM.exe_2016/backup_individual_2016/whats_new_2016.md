What's new since the previous release?

**Baseline fraction maps of organic carbon in Australian soil**

Baseline spatial maps have been included for the RPM, HUM and Inert
pools of organic carbon in soil. Viscarra-Rossel et al. (2014) has
derived spatially explicit estimates, and their uncertainty, of the
distribution and stock of organic carbon in the soil of Australia. This
was achieved through the assembly and harmonisation of data from
Australia's National Soil Carbon Research Program (SCaRP), the National
Geochemical Survey of Australia (NGSA) and the Australian Soil Resource
Information System (ASRIS) to produce the most comprehensive set of data
on the current stock of organic carbon in soil of the continent.

carbon accounting and monitoring under climate change. Global Change
Biology. 20(9):2953-2970.



**Regime Scheduler**

The Events tab has been redesigned to include an interface for managing
both the events and the regimes formed from those events. This
enhancement allows the regimes and events to be moved around, copied,
edited and managed as groups.
