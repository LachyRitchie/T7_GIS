Information for the Species* panel : *Events* button]

Manage the standard events, for the current species (Select a
Species).

The standard events are simply events which are made available for a
species for convenience. The standard events downloaded through
Databuilder are only available for convenience and may not be relevant
or applicable for the particular species of interest. The standard
events should not be confused with the event queue (on the
Events page). The event queue is the queue of events
that will be simulated during a plot simulation.

**Uses**

If you often use a particular event (such as a particular thinning or
harvest) on the *Events* page, you might want to store the event as a
standard event. Then, when you want another such event on the *Events*
page, you can load the input values from the standard event rather than
retyping them. Also, storing the events that are typical for a given
species is helpful when you give the species (as FullCAM data) to
others. This is just a convenience to save typing when creating events
on the event queue.
