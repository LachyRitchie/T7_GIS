[Site : Temperature window : *Frost
Modifier* button]

This time-series Window is where you
specify the frost modifier (modFrost).

**Details**

This time-series is only used if the Forest Productivity
Index is computed from scratch
and the frost modifier is input directly ---
see Configure Tree Production.

The frost modifier is dimensionless, and between 0 and 1. Higher values
result in more NPP being produced by the trees. A value of 1 implies no
frost, and 0 implies no NPP is produced.
