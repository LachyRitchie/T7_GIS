---title: Soil Waterversion: 2016category: Soiloriginal_file: 44_Soil Water_2016.md---[Soil page : *Forest* or *Agricultural* panel : *Water*button]Enter the water-related properties of the soil. It differs slightlybetween agricultural and forest systems. SeeSite : Water.**Ratio of Evapotranspiration to Open-Pan Evaporation**The *Ratio of evapotranspiration to open-pan evaporation* is the ratioof water lost through evapotranspiration (in mm) to water lost byopen-pan evaporation (in mm).The RothC module uses rainfall and evapotranspirationto calculate the topsoil moisture deficit (TSMD). The evapotranspirationis calculated as the product of the open-pan evaporation and this ratio(which is 0.75 for temperate soils).Alternatively, obtain monthly evapotranspiration with adequate accuracyfrom Muller\'s (1982) collection of meteorological data for sites aroundthe world, then enter the evapotranspiration data in the open-panevaporation time-series and set this ratio to one.**Ratio of Bare-to-Covered Maximum TSMD**The *ratio of maximum TSMD for bare soil to maximum TSMD for coveredsoil* is the ratio of the maximum topsoil moisture deficit (TSMD) forbare soil to the maximum TSMD for covered soil.This input is generally taken to be 0.556 (= 5 / 9). It is used byRothC.**Water Info**Opens a window of text information about the partition of the totalsaturated water capability of the soil into:- Inaccessible water.- The maximum topsoil moisture deficit (TSMD) that is accessible by theplants.- Water that drains off.Water in excess of the amount to saturate the soil is excess, and runsoff.Requires that nitrogen simulation be switched on in theConfiguration (which enables the bulk densityparameter on the Soil for the WholePlot panel of theSoil page.)**Parameters for the Top Soil Moisture Deficit (TSMD)**Let> c = the fraction of the soil that is clay, by weight (see Soil for> the Whole Plot)> b = the bulk density of the soil, in t/m^3^ (see Soil for the Whole> Plot)> d = depth of soil sampled, in cm (see Soil> Properties)> r = ratio of max TSMD for bare soil to max TSMD for covered soil (see> above).Then the maximum TSMD in mm is, by soil cover and RothC version,(20 + 130 * c - 100 * c * c) * (d / 23), v26.3, Soil covered(20 + 130 * c - 100 * c * c) * (d / 23) * r, v26.3, Soil bare(0.688405334 + 4.4746369 * c - 3.44203 * c * c) * d+ ln(9) * (0.082530817 + 0.5364083 * c - 0.41268 * c * c) * d,v26.5, Covered or bareThe depth of inaccessible water (water always in the soil, no matter howlong a dry spell continues, but it is inaccessible to plants) in mm is> (0.0445 + 0.41 * c) * 10 * d.The total porosity (WFPS) (the water from totally dry to completelysaturated, after which any additional added water runs off) in mm is> (1 - b / 2.65) * 10 * d.The maximum drainage water is the total porosity less the maximum TSMDless the inaccessible water:total porosity = drainage (soil cannot hold this water, it drains)> + available water (measured by TSMD, varying from 0 to maximum TSMD)> + inaccessible water (always present, no matter how dry the weather).
