Enter the inputs specific to a harvest event.

**Introduction**

The forest counterpart of a harvest is a [Thin] event

A harvest is the only means of forming agricultural products (apart from
grazing, see Grazing Change events), and can
take some of the crop offsite. See the Product
Properties of each species.

**Affected Portion**

The affected portion is the fraction of the agricultural system in which
the harvest takes place. It is typically the fraction of the plot area
that is harvested.

**Clearing Harvest**

For a harvest to be clearing (that is, to clear the agricultural system
of its crop), the affected portion must be 100% and the destination
percentages for each pool must sum to 100%.
