[Site : Water window : *VPD Modifier* button]

This time-series Window is where you
specify the VPD modifier (modVPD).

**Details**

This time-series is only used if the Forest Productivity
Index is computed from scratch
and the Soil Water Modifier is
computed --- see Configure Tree
Production.

The vapour pressure deficit modifier is dimensionless, greater than 0,
and usually less than 1. Higher values result in more NPP being produced
by the trees.

The vapour pressure deficit modifier is restricted to values between 0
and 1.
