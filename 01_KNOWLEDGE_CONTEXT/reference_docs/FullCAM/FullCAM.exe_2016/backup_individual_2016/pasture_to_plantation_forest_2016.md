---title: Pasture to Plantation Forestversion: 2016category: Land Use Changeoriginal_file: 228_Pasture to Plantation Forest_2016.md---DetailsPasture to plantation forest management systems are created in FullCAMby using a plot type of *Multi-layer mixed system*.Other systems that may be created by FullCAM are:Plantation Forest to PlantationForestNative Forest to PlantationForestNative Forest to PastureGrazed WoodlandCrop and Pasture Management**Method***Configuration*- Plot Type : Multi-layer mixed system.*Timing*- Set the timing. The *Start simulation at beginning of* year should beset to 20 years prior to plantation establishment.It is always prudent to 'run the model in' by setting the start yearearlier (up to 20 years) than the actual period of interest. This isbecause the soil carbon data at initialisation represents a pristinecondition, a condition that does not reflect any prior management.*Databuilder*- Set the *Forest percentage for downloading* to 0.Select the required *Trees and Events* (refer Downloading Trees andEvents).- Select an initial rotation *Tree-species/Regimes.* The initial listdisplayed will be ex-pasture plantation *Tree-species/Regimes* only.- Select a subsequent rotation *Tree-species/Regimes.* Subsequent listsdisplayed will be subsequent rotation plantation*Tree-species/Regimes* only.Subsequent rotation *Tree-species/Regimes* may be selected anddownloaded as often as required. Additional *Tree-species/Regimes* canbe added either within the same *Tree-species groups* or from othergroups to model transitions from one plantation species to another.Select the required *Crops and Events* (refer Downloading Crops andEvents).- Select *Download Tree and Crop Species Required By the Event Queue*.This will add crop species *Agriculture plantation weed species* andalso relevant events.The plot should now be ready to simulate. There is no need tospecifically download any crop information from *Crops and Events*.
