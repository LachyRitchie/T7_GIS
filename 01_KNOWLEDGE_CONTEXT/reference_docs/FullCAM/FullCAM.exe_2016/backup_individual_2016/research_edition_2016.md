Standard and Research Editions

Each version of FullCAM comes in two editions, the standard edition and
the research edition. This edition of FullCAM is the standard edition.

The research edition of FullCAM is intended only for professional
researchers in carbon accounting and plant modelling, such as at the
Department of the Environment or Australia's CSIRO. The research edition
is available on request from the Department of the Environment on a
case-by-case basis.

**Differences in Appearance**

The research edition is distinguished from the standard edition by the
word "research" in:

- The version name on the *Startup* and *About* windows.
- The title bar of the Main Window.

**Differences in Function**

Functionally, the research edition differs from the standard edition in
that:

- It includes the 3PG tree growth model. Both editions contain the
  3PG-lite model for computing the Forest Productivity Index
  (FPI).
- It can calculate the Forest Productivity Index from scratch.
- It can do Nitrogen Simulation (other than just in the mulch, as part
  of GENDEC).
- It includes version 26.5 of RothC.
