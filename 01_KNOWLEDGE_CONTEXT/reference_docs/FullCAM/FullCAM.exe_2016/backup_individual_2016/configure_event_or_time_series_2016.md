---title: Configure Event Or time-seriesversion: 2016category: Configurationoriginal_file: 195_Configure Event Or time-series_2016.md---[Configuration page: *Events or time-series*button]Specify certain inputs as either by time-series or by events.Press the 'Events' or 'time-series' button to access the windowwhere you decide where various sorts of inputs are treated as event oras time-series data.**Introduction**FullCAM only allows events if a multi-layer plot is modelled (seeConfigure the Plot), so if modelling aplot that is not multi-layer then time-series data will always be used.You can change these settings at any time without losing any of thetime-series or event data you may have entered.If you do not want any of a particular input (for example, there is noirrigation in your simulation), it is easiest to set its input type to*Events*, but do not create any events of that type. This way you willnot be asked for the time-series input.Some inputs, such as irrigation, can be specified either as events or astime-series. This is where you configure how they are to be specified.Unless the complete forest (CAMFor) or complete agricultural system(CAMAg) or both are modelled then FullCAM does no allow (or process)event and thus time-series data will always be used.**Irrigation**For a discussion of irrigation, see Site : Water.Set the irrigation:- As time-series: The DefiniteIrrigation and ConditionalIrrigation time-series- As events: Irrigation Change events.**Manure-From-Offsite Added to the Soil**Manure from offsite can be added to the soil whenever the soil ismodeled.Set the manure additions:- As time-series: The Manure Inputs to Soil fromOffsitetime-series- As events: Manure-From-OffsiteChange events.
