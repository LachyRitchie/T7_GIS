[3PG Leaves window: *Percentage of Precipitation
Intercepted by the Tree Canopy* button]

This time-series Window is where you
specify the percentage of precipitation (Rainfall,
Definite Irrigation, and Conditional
Irrigation) that does not get to the
soil because it is intercepted by the tree canopy, for the current
species (Select a Species).

**Details**

The percentage will vary by season (especially if the trees are
deciduous) and by the age of the trees.

This time-series is used by 3PG, and also by 3PG-lite to
compute the soil water modifier --- see Configure Tree
Production.

The intercept percentage is typically from 0 to 20%. Higher values
result in lower amounts of available soil water, and thus to lower
growth.
