[Configuration page : *Risk Analysis* panel]

Specify whether you want to do [Risk Analyses](risk_analysis.md).

**Use**

The plot document is "configured for risk analyses" if you check the box
for [Sensitivity Analysis](sensitivity_analysis.md), in which
case the [Risk Inputs](risk_inputs.md) page becomes accessible.

Turning on risk analyses has no effect on regular plot simulations; it
merely allows the possibility of risk analyses.
