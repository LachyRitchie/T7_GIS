**Plants**

\[*Trees* page or *Crops* page in the input window of a plot document\]

These two pages, the [Trees](215_Trees.htm) page and the
[Crops](216_Crops.htm) page, are where you describe the species on the
plot. They are each partitioned into three panels:

- [Select a Species](56_Select%20a%20Species.htm) panel
- [Properties of the Species](145_Properties%20of%20the%20Species.htm)
  panel

**About Species**

Clearing events, such as a [Thin](140_Thin.htm),
[Harvest](153_Harvest.htm), [Forest Fire](144_Forest%20Fire.htm), or
[Agricultural Fire](149_Agricultural%20Fire.htm), can remove the plants
if there are plants growing.

If there are no plants growing (that is, the system is clear), then
planting events, namely [Plant Trees](158_Plant%20Trees.htm) or [Plant
Crop](161_Plant%20Crop.htm), can set plants growing on the plot. A
planting event can plant any species listed on this panel.

By clearing one species then planting a different species, a plot can
have several different species growing during the plot simulation - but
only one species growing in a system at any one time.

The debris and products of each species are tracked separately, because
they have characteristics that may differ from species to species.
However, all species are treated the same with respect to the mulch and
soil - different species merely have different proportions of
decomposable or resistant material, and different proportions of
\"more-resistant\" material in the resistant material.
