Native Forest to Plantation Forest

Details

Native forest to plantation forest management systems are created in
FullCAM by using a plot type of *Multi-layer forest system*.

Other systems that may be created by FullCAM are:

[Pasture to Plantation
Forest](228_Pasture%20to%20Plantation%20Forest.htm)\
[Plantation Forest to Plantation
Forest](229_Plantation%20Forest%20to%20Plantation%20Forest.htm)\
[Native Forest to Pasture](231_Native%20Forest%20to%20Pasture.htm)\
[Grazed Woodland](232_Grazed%20Woodland.htm)\
[Crop and Pasture Management](233_Crop%20and%20Pasture%20Management.htm)

**Method**

*Configuration*

- Plot Type : Multi-layer forest system.

*Databuilder*

Select the required *Trees and Events* (refer [Downloading Trees and
Events](208_Downloading%20Trees%20and%20Events.htm)).

- Select Tree species group *Local species*.
- Select an initial rotation *Tree-species/Regimes.* The initial list
  displayed will be *Local species* only.
- Select a subsequent rotation *Tree-species/Regimes.* This will require
  you to select another Tree species group value. Subsequent lists
  displayed will be plantation *Tree-species/Regimes* only.

Subsequent rotation *Tree-species/Regimes* may be selected and
downloaded as often as required. Additional *Tree-species/Regimes* can
be added either within the same *Tree-species groups* or from other
groups to model transitions from one plantation species to another.
