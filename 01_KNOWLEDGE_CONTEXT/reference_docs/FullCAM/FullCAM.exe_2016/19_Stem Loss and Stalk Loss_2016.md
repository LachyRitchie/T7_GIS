**Stem Loss and Stalk Loss**

\[[Plant Properties](43_Plant%20Properties.htm) window : *Stem Loss*
button\]

This [time-series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) is where enter
the stem loss rate of a tree species or the stalk loss rate of a crop
species. See [Mortality](121_Mortality.htm).

**Details**

  Vegetation Type   Definition of \'Plant Death\'
  ----------------- -------------------------------
  Forest            stem death
  Agricultural      stalk death

This time-series specifies plant mortality --- the percentage of stems
or stalks (and thus plants) that die per year. To make the mortality
rate a function of tree age, set the *Years are* in the *Timing* panel
to *Years since plants sprouted*.

The type of plant age to use in this time-series, if it is expressed in
years since the plants sprouted, is chosen in the *Properties of the
Species time-series* section in the [Growth
Properties](42_Growth%20Properties.htm) window.

The percentages in this time-series are limited to less than 100% ---
use one of the [Events](136_Events.htm) to kill the whole forest or
crop.
