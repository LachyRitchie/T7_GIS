**Stem Density**

\[[Plant Properties](43_Plant%20Properties.htm) window : *Stem Density*
button\]

This [time-series Window](135_time-series%20window.htm) is where enter
the stem density (also known as the \"basic density\") of a tree
species.

**Details**

FullCAM uses masses for all its calculations, so stem density is only
used to convert between stem masses and stem volumes. You require stem
density if:

- Modelling a multilayer forest and any of the following:
  - Tree growth is specified by stem volume increments
  - The amount of stem material is specified by volume in the initial
    conditions
  - The amount of stem material in any tree planting is specified by
    volume.

If stem density is not required for any of the above then it is not used
(that is, it will not affect FullCAM calculations), even though you are
free to enter it into the document.

See the *Properties of the Species time-series* section of [Growth
Properties](42_Growth%20Properties.htm).

If only the trees are modelled, the plant age used in the stem density
time-series is the maximum age of the plants (there are no events in
this configuration, so the maximum and average ages are the same).

Because the stem density is a time-series, it may vary with the age of
the tree (set *Years are* to \"Years since plants sprouted\") or with
the year (set *Years are* to \"Calendar years\" or \"Years since start
of simulation\").

The stem density is of the whole stem at the time indicated, not of the
new stem growth in that year. The units are kilograms per cubic metre
(note: most other masses in FullCAM are in tonnes).

The density of stem wood is typically about 300 -- 1,000 kgdm/m^3^. A
compendium of wood densities for Australian tree species can be found in
the [NCAS Technical Report No.
18](reps/TR18%20Woody%20Density%20Phase%201%20-%20State%20of%20Knowledge.pdf){target="reps18"}.

If you have only a single number for stem density, just use that. (Set
*Years of data* to 1, *Data points per year* to 1, resize the
time-series, and enter the stem density in the single cell of the
time-series. *Years are* and *Extrapolation* can be set to anything.)

Typical values for native forest communities are described in Table 7 of
*Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Land Use Change in Australia: An
Integrated Application of the National Carbon Accounting System*.
Additional species specific values can be extracted from the FullCAM
database.
