**Simulation Steps**

\[[Timing](199_Timing.htm) page : *Simulation Steps* panel\]

Set the amount of time in a simulation step (all simulation steps
simulate the same amount of time).

A (simulation) *step* is the unit of time considered by a FullCAM
simulation. In each step, there is exactly one material movement from
one pool to the next pool due to processes (see [Processes and
Events](58_Processes%20and%20Events.htm)). Each step always simulates
the same amount of time. Steps are like the heartbeats of the model:
material moves from pool to adjoining pool once per step (exception:
more than once if the step is interrupted by an event).

The shorter the steps, the longer a plot simulation takes.

### Choosing the Length of Simulation Steps

*Time Resolution of Input Data*

If you specify the rainfall to FullCAM as just the total rainfall each
year (that is, one number per year), then it is unrealistic to expect
FullCAM to accurately simulate monthly or weekly phenomena that are
influenced by rainfall. Monthly simulation steps might be appropriate,
but the results might have to be interpreted carefully.

*Computing Time and Memory*

In a lengthy simulation or one with many outputs, there may not be
enough computer memory to do a simulation with very short steps, or it
might take longer to compute than is convenient. This problem will
probably only arise when simulating estates.

*Graininess*

In FullCAM, each atom of material belongs to one pool (such as trees
leaves), and carbon moves between the various pools once per step (at
the end of the step). While the rate of circulation of material among
the pools is mainly governed by the various physiological and empirical
rate inputs, it is subtly influenced by the length of step and
occasionally this is significant.

Consider carbon that flows from pool A to pool B to pool C (for example,
tree leaves to leaf litter to soluble mulch). It takes one step for any
carbon from pool A to reach pool B, and a second step for any of it to
reach pool C. If the steps are yearly then it takes two years for ANY
carbon from pool A to reach pool C, while with daily steps some carbon
can get to pool C by the end of the second day!

In reality, the step length is vanishingly small: carbon moves between
pools continuously, rather than in discrete movements that occur once
every beat of our simulation clock. Now, we want to model the essential
nature of the system with as little computing effort as possible. If we
decrease the step length then we get a more realistic simulation, but we
do more computing. This dependence of the simulation results on the step
length is called *graininess*.

FullCAM performs its calculations efficiently. It runs near the maximum
possible speed on your computer --- and your computer is probably a
supercomputer by the standards of a decade ago. So speed of computation
is not much of a limiting factor. The precision of the quantities in
FullCAM is relatively low so round-off error is almost insignificant ---
but there is little point in using more steps than necessary in case the
round off error begins to affect your results. FullCAM's speed of
computation and flexibility in its treatment of time allows you to
overcome the artificial barriers set by arbitrary and fixed frequencies
of simulations steps that are present in many other models.

What is a sensible amount of time per step? As you decrease the step
length, you will find your simulated results will gradually approach
limiting values. The limiting values are simulation results that stay
the same, no matter how much you further decrease the step length. From
the perspective of graininess, an appropriate step length is the step
length that gets you close to the limiting values. For example, if
halving the step length does not change the results much then there is
no point in decreasing it further.

As a rough rule of thumb, for negligible graininess use a step length of
at most a month unless modelling for detailed results (such as in an
academic or scientific situation).
