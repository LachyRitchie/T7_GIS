**Properties of the Species**

\[[Trees](215_Trees.htm) page or [Crops](216_Crops.htm) page :
*Properties of the Species* panel\]

Enter the properties of the current species ([Select a
Species](56_Select%20a%20Species.htm)).

**Readiness**

The concept of readiness is described in general in [General
Features](20_General%20Features.htm).

Buttons for mandatory FullCAM properties are shown in black if they are
complete, red if not. Buttons for optional FullCAM properties are shown
in black if they are complete, orange if not. The Notes button is shown
in bold font if any notes have been entered for the species. The name of
the species must be completed, and it must be unique. If any of the
properties are not fully specified, then the species cannot be
simulated.

**Plantation type**

The Plantation type is editable in a database document and displayed in
a plot document. It is used in spatial simulations to differentiate
between *Other tree*, *Softwood* and *Hardwood* Plantation types.
