**Species or Regime Selection : Forest or Agricultural Regime Filter**

\[[Species or Regime
Selection](225_Species%20or%20Regime%20Selection.htm) : *Forest or
Agricultrual regime filter* panel\]

Select forest or agricultural regime specific filters to filter the
forest or agricultural regimes list displayed.

**Details**

A forest or agricultural regime filter may be used to filter a forest or
agricultural regime list.

**Forest regime filter**

[Regimes](235_Regimes.htm) may be filtered by any combination of:

*State\
Previous land use\
Site preparation\
Post planting weed control\
NPI\
Cultivation\
Thinning Pruning*

If the [Species or Regime
Selection](225_Species%20or%20Regime%20Selection.htm) window has been
accessed from the [Data Builder](132_Data%20Builder.htm) page, then the
State and NPI filters are disabled as the list has already been filtered
by State and NPI region.

**Agricultural regime filter**

Agricultural regimes may be filtered by the Configuration option that
they apply to.

The forest or agricultural regime filter is applied in conjunction with
the [Species or Regime Selection : Text Match
Filter](223_Species%20or%20Regime%20Selection_Text%20Match%20Filter.htm)
to display forest or agricultural regimes in the list.
