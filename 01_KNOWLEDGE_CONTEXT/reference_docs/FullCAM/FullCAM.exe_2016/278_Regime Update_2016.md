**Regime Update**

\[*Events* page : *Clone Regimes* Panel\]

\[*Events* page : *Regime Edit* Dialogue\]

**Use**

Regime Timing can be updated for multiple regimes at once. This can be
either a positive or negative offset from the current timing, and is
irrespective of the type (Calendar date or Days since start of
simulation).

Regime Timing may be updated for multiple regimes by multi-selecting the
regimes on the Regime List, and then selecting Clone from the right
mouse options.

**Clone Regime**

Clones the selected regimes and applies an offset to the original events
of the years and days specified. This can be particularly useful if you
wish to clone [Regimes](235_Regimes.htm).

**Minimise Gaps**

The right mouse option includes the "minimise gaps" feature. This will
compress the regime queue by removing free time between regimes. It will
do this by changing the year value of later regimes if there is room for
them to occur earlier based on the date of the final event in the
earlier regime.
