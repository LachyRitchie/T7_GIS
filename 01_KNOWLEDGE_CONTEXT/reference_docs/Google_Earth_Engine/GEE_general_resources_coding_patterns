# Google Earth Engine comprehensive knowledge base

Google Earth Engine (GEE) represents a planetary-scale platform for Earth science data analysis, providing over **80 petabytes of geospatial data** alongside massive computational resources. This comprehensive knowledge base covers all essential documentation, architectural concepts, programming patterns, and community resources necessary for mastering the platform.

## Official documentation and downloadable resources

The primary documentation hub at **developers.google.com/earth-engine** serves as the central repository for all official GEE resources, offering JavaScript, Python, and REST API documentation with comprehensive tutorials and examples.

### Core documentation sections

The platform provides multiple API references, with the **JavaScript API** documented at developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs offering complete class and method documentation in both structured and single-page searchable formats. The **Python API** guide at developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install covers installation procedures, authentication methods, and syntax differences between JavaScript and Python implementations. The **REST API reference** at developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest provides complete endpoint documentation for direct HTTP access to Earth Engine servers.

The **Earth Engine Data Catalog** at developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets contains documentation for 40+ years of satellite imagery across 80+ petabytes of data, organized by categories including Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, climate data, terrain models, and land cover products. Each dataset includes detailed metadata, band specifications, usage examples, and code snippets.

### Export and import specifications

Earth Engine supports comprehensive export capabilities to **Google Drive, Google Cloud Storage, and Earth Engine assets**. Images can be exported in GeoTIFF and TFRecord formats with configurable parameters for scale, CRS, and region. Table exports support CSV, Shapefile, GeoJSON, KML, KMZ, and TFRecord formats with specific constraints for each format. The platform also enables video creation from ImageCollections as MP4 files and map tile generation in TMS format for web applications.

Import capabilities include **GeoTIFF** as the primary raster format with support for various compression methods (ZSTD recommended), **TFRecord** for machine learning workflows, **Shapefiles** for vector data, and **CSV** for tabular data and point geometries. The Asset Manager allows uploading personal data with storage quotas and private asset management.

## Fundamental architecture and computation model

Google Earth Engine employs a sophisticated **lazy evaluation model** where operations build a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) rather than executing immediately. This deferred execution means pixels aren't computed until needed for display or export, allowing the system to optimize computation graphs dynamically and preview results at any zoom level without waiting for full resolution processing.

### Client versus server operations

The distinction between client and server operations is fundamental to GEE. **Client-side operations** occur in the browser (JavaScript Code Editor) or local system (Python API) and are limited to building computation descriptions. All **`ee.*` functions execute on Google's servers**, with objects starting with `ee.` serving as proxy objects containing no actual data. In Python, these require `getInfo()` calls to retrieve actual values, and the entire system is designed for massive parallel processing across Google's infrastructure.

### Processing architecture

The platform uses **tile-based computation** where operations split into tiles processed separately on multiple machines. Complex operations employ various distributed processing strategies with the constraint that all inputs necessary for an output tile must fit into memory. The system abstracts processing power through **Earth Engine Compute Units (EECUs)**, which represent instantaneous processing capabilities across different processor types and architectures.

GEE manages petabyte-scale data through **multi-resolution image pyramids**, with each image ingested at multiple resolution levels. The pyramiding policies vary based on data type: continuous values use MEAN of lower level pixels while discrete values use SAMPLE (typically top-left pixel). The system lazily selects appropriate pyramid levels based on zoom and scale requirements.

### Processing environments

The platform operates in two distinct modes. The **Interactive Environment** is optimized for small, fast requests (under 5 minutes, tens of MB) with real-time data exploration using Maps Mercator projection for display. The **Batch Environment** handles large-scale processing with maximum task lifetimes of 10 days, supporting up to 3000 pending tasks per project queued by priority and submission time.

## Programming patterns and best practices

### JavaScript patterns

Successful GEE programming requires embracing **functional programming patterns** over procedural approaches. Always use `map()` operations instead of for-loops for parallel processing, leverage filter and reduce patterns, and avoid `ee.Algorithms.If()` in favor of functional approaches. When processing collections, **filter early and often** by applying spatial, temporal, and metadata filters before expensive operations.

```javascript
// Good: Functional approach with proper filtering
var processed = collection
  .select(['B4', 'B3', 'B2'])
  .filterBounds(geometry)
  .filterDate('2020-01-01', '2020-12-31')
  .filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE', 10))
  .map(function(image) {
    return image.normalizedDifference(['B5', 'B4']);
  });
```

### Python API differences

The Python API uses **lambda functions** instead of anonymous functions and supports keyword arguments with `**kwargs`. Snake_case is preferred over camelCase for Python variables, and complex operations benefit from traditional named functions rather than lambdas.

```python
# Complex processing with named function
def complex_processing(image):
    ndvi = image.normalizedDifference(['B8', 'B4']).rename('NDVI')
    evi = image.expression(
        '2.5 * ((NIR - RED) / (NIR + 6 * RED - 7.5 * BLUE + 1))',
        {'NIR': image.select('B8'), 'RED': image.select('B4'), 'BLUE': image.select('B2')}
    ).rename('EVI')
    return image.addBands([ndvi, evi])

result = collection.map(complex_processing)
```

### Performance optimization strategies

To avoid computation timeouts, **apply filters before expensive operations**, use Export for long-running tasks, optimize pixel resolution appropriately, and set `bestEffort: true` in `reduceRegion()` calls. For memory management, avoid unnecessary clipping operations, use `updateMask()` instead of `mask()` to preserve existing masks, minimize array conversions, and set appropriate `tileScale` parameters (typically 16) to reduce memory per tile.

When combining reducers for efficiency:
```javascript
var stats = image.reduceRegion({
  reducer: ee.Reducer.mean().combine({
    reducer2: ee.Reducer.stdDev(),
    sharedInputs: true
  }),
  geometry: geometry,
  scale: 30,
  bestEffort: true
});
```

## Essential reference materials

### Data type specifications

Earth Engine provides comprehensive data types including **ee.Image** for single rasters with multiple bands, **ee.ImageCollection** for stacks of images, **ee.Feature** for vector geometries with properties, and **ee.FeatureCollection** for collections of features. Geometry types support Points, LineStrings, Polygons, and their multi-geometry variants with automatic CRS handling.

### Band specifications and QA documentation

**Landsat collections** use standardized band naming: Landsat 8/9 bands B1-B11 include coastal aerosol through thermal bands, while Landsat 7 uses B1-B8. The QA_PIXEL band provides bit-packed quality assessment information with specific bits for cloud, cloud shadow, snow, and water detection.

**Sentinel-2** provides bands B1-B12 at varying resolutions (10m, 20m, 60m) with QA60 for cloud masking. Bit 10 indicates opaque clouds while Bit 11 marks cirrus clouds, enabling effective cloud filtering through bitwise operations.

### Projection and scale handling

Earth Engine uses a **"pull-based" projection system** where output projection is determined by visualization or export parameters. The default projection is WGS84 (EPSG:4326) with 1-degree scale for composites. Common projections include EPSG:3857 for Web Mercator (Code Editor default) and EPSG:32600-32760 for UTM zones.

Scale parameters specify resolution in meters per pixel, with native resolutions varying by sensor: Landsat at 30m (visible/NIR) and 100m (thermal), Sentinel-2 at 10m/20m/60m (band-dependent), and MODIS at 250m/500m/1km (product-dependent).
