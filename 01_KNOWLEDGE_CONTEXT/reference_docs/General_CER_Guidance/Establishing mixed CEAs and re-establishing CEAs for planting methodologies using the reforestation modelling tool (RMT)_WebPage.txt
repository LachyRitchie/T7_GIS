Environmental plantings
and
mallee methodology determinations
use the reforestation modelling tool (RMT) when calculating abatement. For both methodology determinations there are situations where establishing and re-establishing mixed carbon estimation areas are complex. These situations require specific RMT inputs.
Establishing CEAs using mixed methods
If a carbon estimation area (CEA) is established using both direct seeding and tree planting methods it may not be feasible to stratify the CEA into seeded and planted areas. In these cases, the CEA must be modelled in the RMT using the direct seeding setting. There is one exception to the rule and that is when evidence of the density of planted stems proves the need for a tree planting density setting.
Re-establishing CEAs where re-stratification is required
If there is partial failure of a seeding or planting, a project may be left with a successful portion of a CEA and an unsuccessful portion that needs to be re-established or excluded. Re-stratifying the area will create two new CEAs:
The successful portion will retain the original seeding or planting details in the RMT.
If re-established, the unsuccessful portion will use the new establishment date in the RMT.
Re-establishing CEAs where re-stratification is not feasible
If there is partial failure of seeds or stems that is spread across the whole CEA, it may not be feasible to re-stratify the area into successful and unsuccessful portions. In this situation you will need to re-establish the CEA and alter the inputs to the RMT accordingly (see tables below). This will retain the conservative modelling results of the RMT.
How to use the RMT for re-establishing CEAs where re-stratification is not feasible
When using the RMT select a "tree-planting-date" and "management-regime" for each CEA within your project.
Tree-planting-date
means when trees have been established (i.e. seeding or planting finish date).
Management-regime
means the establishment method and must be selected from:
direct seeding
low-density planting
medium-density planting, or
high-density planting.
The tables below show the options for re-establishing CEAs where re-stratification is not feasible, and the settings to use in the RMT for possible scenarios. These options can be summarised as follows:
If the original seeding or planting
will not
meet the definition of forest (20 per cent cover potential), the date the new planting occurs must be the date entered into the RMT. You must also enter the correct management-regime used for this new planting.
If the original seeding or planting
will
meet the definition of forest (20 per cent cover potential) but another seeding or planting event is added using the same or a 'lower' management-regime than used previously (see numbered list of management-regimes above), the date of the first planting must be used in the RMT. For example, Bob used a medium-density planting as his original management-regime. When he adds another seeding or planting event, it will be either medium-density, low-density or direct seeding. It will not be a high-density management-regime.
If the original seeding o​r planting
will
meet the definition of forest (20 per cent cover potential) but another seeding or planting event is added using a 'higher' management-regime than used previously, the date of the new planting may be used in the RMT. For example, Ruby used a medium-density planting as her original management-regime. When she adds another seeding or planting event, it will be high-density. It will not be direct seeding, low-density or a medium-density management regime.

Notes
* Assessing whether the level of success of the original establishment has more or less than 20% cover potential, and providing evidence of same, may require use of the stem density table included in the explanatory statement to the methodology determinations, and time-stamped photos and/or aerial imagery. The assessment should be conservative.
** This guidance is intended only for RMT modelling of re-established CEAs where the failure has happened in such a manner that re-stratification into successful and unsuccessful (re-established) areas is not feasible.
1 "using stem density" refers to only those circumstances in which the relevant stem density is high enough to warrant use of the medium and high stem density setting in RMT. In all other circumstances, the low stem density setting must be used.
