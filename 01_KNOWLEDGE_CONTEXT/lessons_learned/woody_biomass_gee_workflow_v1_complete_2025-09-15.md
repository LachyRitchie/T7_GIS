## 📚 LESSONS LEARNED

### **1. GEE Python API Environment Management**
**Issue:** Multiple Python environment conflicts causing import failures
**Solution:** Created dedicated conda environment `gee_workflow` with Python 3.11
**Key Learning:** Always use full path to Python executable when environments conflict
```bash
# Working command pattern:
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/gee_workflow/bin/python script.py
```

### **2. Binary Mask File Size Expectations**
**Issue:** Initial concern about 80KB file sizes for binary masks
**Discovery:** This is NORMAL and expected due to LZW compression of binary data
**Key Learning:** Binary masks (0/1 values) compress extremely efficiently - 80KB is correct for ~1M pixels

### **3. GEE Export Pipeline vs Visualization Pipeline**
**Critical Discovery:** GEE's visualization and export pipelines handle masked pixels differently
**Solution:** Use `unmask({value: 0, sameFootprint: false})` for binary masks
**Key Learning:** Visualization shows masked pixels as transparent, exports exclude them entirely

### **4. Canvas Method for Dense Rasters**
**Technique:** Use `canvas.where(binary_mask.selfMask(), 1)` to ensure complete coverage
**Benefit:** Guarantees all pixels in export region are included, preventing tiny file issues
**Key Learning:** Canvas approach is more reliable than direct binary mask export

### **5. Method Alignment Between JavaScript and Python**
**Issue:** Brightness calculation discrepancy between GEE Code Editor and Python API
**Solution:** Ensure both use only visible bands (B2, B3, B4) for brightness calculation
**Key Learning:** Always validate method consistency across different GEE interfaces

### **6. File Organization and Versioning**
**System:** Implemented numeric versioning (v1.0, v2.0) for script evolution
**Structure:** Clear separation of current working vs archived files
**Key Learning:** Proper versioning prevents confusion and enables rollback if needed

## 🔧 TECHNICAL INSIGHTS

### **GEE Export Best Practices:**
```python
# Essential configuration for binary mask exports
task = ee.batch.Export.image.toDrive(
    image=full_mask,
    description=export_name,
    folder='GEE_Outbox',  # Single folder for all exports
    scale=10,
    crs='EPSG:4326',
    region=export_region,
    maxPixels=1e13,
    fileFormat='GeoTIFF',
    formatOptions={
        'cloudOptimized': True,
        'noData': 255
    }
)
```

### **KML Processing Pattern:**
```python
# Reliable KML to GEE FeatureCollection conversion
def load_kml_boundary(file_path, property_name):
    tree = ET.parse(file_path)
    root = tree.getroot()
    coords_elem = root.find('.//{http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2}coordinates')
    # Process coordinates and create GeoJSON
    return ee.FeatureCollection(geojson)
```

### **Method Definition Pattern:**
```python
# Consistent method definition structure
methods = {
    'Original': {
        'description': 'Original Best (Score > 0.15)',
        'logic': lambda: woody_score.gt(0.15)
    },
    'Refined_B': {
        'description': 'Refined B (Score + Veg History)',
        'logic': lambda: woody_score.gt(0.15).And(ndvi_max.gt(0.25))
    }
    # ... etc
}
```

- **Before:** Multiple timestamped folders per property
- **After:** Single `GEE_Outbox` folder for all exports
- **Benefit:** Easier file management and download

### **2. Simplified Naming Convention**
- **Pattern:** `Woody[Method]_[FarmName]_[Date].tif`
- **Examples:** `WoodyOriginal_BonzaFarm_20250915.tif`
- **Benefit:** Clear, consistent, sortable filenames

### **3. Automated Task Monitoring**
- **Feature:** Real-time progress tracking with elapsed time
- **Benefit:** Clear visibility into processing status
- **Implementation:** 30-second check intervals with status reporting

### **4. Error Handling and Validation**
- **Checks:** Boundary validation, image count verification, authentication status
- **Benefit:** Early detection of issues before processing begins
- **Implementation:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks with descriptive error messages
