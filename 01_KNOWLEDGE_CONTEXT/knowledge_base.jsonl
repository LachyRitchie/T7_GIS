# Knowledge Base Migration Notice

This file has been replaced with a new structured index system as of 2025-09-15.

## New Index Location
**Primary Index:** `knowledge_base_index.md` 
**Manifest:** `manifest.json`

## Migration Summary
- **Old system:** Large JSONL file with chunked content (difficult to maintain)
- **New system:** Structured markdown index with direct file references (practical and maintainable)
- **Content:** All content reorganized in `/01_KNOWLEDGE_CONTEXT/` structure
- **Status:** Version 4.0 production ready

## Key Changes
1. **Binary mask documentation:** Consolidated into single authoritative guide (v4.0)
2. **Lessons learned:** Properly categorized and archived outdated content
3. **Reference docs:** Organized by ACCU method and currency (active vs expired)
4. **Successful pipelines:** Validated workflows with success metrics
5. **Search strategy:** Clear priority order for finding information

## Usage
Instead of searching through JSONL chunks, use the structured index in `knowledge_base_index.md` which provides:
- Quick access to critical production methods
- Clear organization by category and status
- Direct file paths and descriptions
- Priority search strategy
