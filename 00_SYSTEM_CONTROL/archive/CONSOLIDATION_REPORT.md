**Folders Eliminated:** 3 (06, 07, 08)
**Top-level folders reduced from:** 12 → 7 active folders

---

## 🎯 BENEFITS ACHIEVED

### Before
- 12 top-level folders
- Unclear purpose for some folders
- Setup materials at root level
- Old scripts cluttering workspace

### After  
- 7 active top-level folders
- Every folder has clear ongoing purpose
- Setup materials logically organized
- Old scripts properly archived

### Improvements
1. **Cleaner root** - Only active working folders visible
2. **Logical organization** - Setup in setup/, old in archive/
3. **Reduced confusion** - Clear what's current vs. historical
4. **Easier navigation** - Fewer folders to search through

---

## 📋 REMAINING CLEANUP

### Empty Folder to Remove
```bash
# Remove empty 08_TOOLS folder
rmdir "/Volumes/T7 Shield/08_TOOLS/_DRIVE_TOOLS"
rmdir "/Volumes/T7 Shield/08_TOOLS"
```

### Already Cleaned
- ✅ 01_CONTEXT (already deleted)
- ✅ 02_KNOWLEDGE_BASE (already deleted)
- ✅ 06_PYTHON_ENVIRONMENT (moved)
- ✅ 07_SCRIPTS (archived)

---

## 🚀 FINAL STATE

**Active Working Folders:** 7
1. `00_SYSTEM_CONTROL` - System governance & setup
2. `01_KNOWLEDGE_CONTEXT` - Knowledge & learning
3. `02_BASE_DATA` - Source datasets
4. `03_DATA_PROJECTS` - Active projects
5. `04_FARM_ASSESSMENT` - Farm assessments
6. `05_TEMPLATES_LAYOUTS` - Templates
7. `09_ARCHIVE` - Historical materials

**Result:** Clean, logical, purpose-driven folder structure

---

## ✅ CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE

The T7 Shield drive now has a streamlined structure where:
- Every top-level folder serves an ongoing purpose
- Setup materials are in `00_SYSTEM_CONTROL/setup/`
- Old scripts are in `09_ARCHIVE/`
- No confusion between active and historical materials
